## Skill Reform

Natural

## Natural Skills
Natural skills involve doing stuff that most everyone has some level of basic familiarity with. This includes both raw physicality and  basic social skills. With that assumed familiarity the defaulting penalty for using physical skills untrained is zero: you can always still make a raw attribute test without penalty. A very strong person can be fairly effective on that basis alone, an intuitive person can easily notice things, and so on and so forth.
* Athletics
* Empathy
* Intimidation
* _Perception_
* Persuasion
* Stealth
* Tactics -> Leadership

## Trained Skills
Trained skills are things that you tend to not do well if you've never tried them before but that have a lot of general or shared application across their scope. Once you've involved yourself in war or crime you generally have to pick up some general Combat or Larceny quickly or you'll miss important details involved in not getting shot. Due to this broad familiarity skills apply a -1 penalty when defaulting, but one point is still useful regardless of specialization.
* _Animal Ken_ -> Tactics
* Combat
* Drive
* Expression
* Larceny
* Research
* Survival

## Technical Skills
Technical skills are areas so specialized that knowledge doesn't transfer easily even within their domain. Technical skills apply the -1 penalty for defaulting if a character doesn't have an appropriate specialization. That is, a character may have Artisan (Painting), but they will still have to default when welding. A character who becomes trained in any Technical skill gains a specialization in that skill for free. Technical skills most frequently pair with the Logic attribute.
* Artisan
* Bureaucracy
* Electronics -> Technology
* Medicine
* Operations
* Rigging
* _Sabotage_ -> Grind

### Grind

Grind is the ability to keep doing things even when they don't seem to get you anywhere. In part it is resolve and self-discipline, but it's also the ability to harness and manipulate your own emotions to get the results you need. 

**Specializations:** Meditation, Physical Endurance, Emotional Regulation


### Skill Examples

Gambling: Edge, Agility + Larceny to cheat
Repair: Logic + Artisan or Logic + Rigging
Custom Bullets: Logic + Artisan (Gunsmithing)
Full-auto conversion: Logic + Artisan (Gunsmithing)
Custom Melee Weapons: Logic + Artisan or Logic + Rigging (various)

Bumping a retail lock: Agility + Larceny or Agility + Rigging, threshold 1, 1 minute (net hits to timeframe)
Picking a lock: Agility + Larceny or Agility + Rigging, threshold lock rating, 5 minutes (net hits to timeframe)
Jimmying a door: Strength + Larceny or Strength + Rigging, threshold 3, Complex action


# Rules not to miss

For every point that a character's Willpower exceeds 2, they can ignore one point of wound penalty. For example, a character with a Willpower of 4 can ignore the wound penalties imposed by 2 of their boxes.

# New Monsters

Playable Ghost

Exemplar: Annie from Being Human
Annie has telekinesis, teleportation, invisibility to muggles, walking through walls, seeing auras, sensing and transmitting thoughts and feelings through physical contact, indestructibility unless she loses her connection to her house or loved ones, and the ability to destroy other ghosts. Ghosts also can hide others in the clothes they died in, making them invisible, and she can also share her memories with others so they may be able to see them, but they exist in her place in her own memories.
 The Empath: In Series 2 she learned to feel tastes and sensations through physical contact.
 Fearless Undead: She often reminds others (and herself) that, being dead already, she has very little to fear from any physical danger. She can however be taken into the afterlife by other ghosts or mysterious otherworldly forces, and removing her emotional connections allows her to be disintegrated. She's come back from the latter once due to her friends coming back and sheer willpower, but Herrick suggests that burning down her house and killing her friends would destroy her permanently.

#### Arsenal

An Arsenal is a collection of useful material things, paradigmatically weapons. Arsenals overlap heavily with Finances and Secrets because they are valuable things that you can trade with other people, but the difference is that you have an Arsenal for the primary reason that you want to _use_ them for something.

A core part of the Arsenals of most supernatural creatures and the people that hunt them is the monster hunting kit. A basic kit consists of some improvised melee weapons made of iron, silver, and wood, a few containers of salt, sand, and seeds, a few balloons, and a natural magnet and a few bottles of water and vodka for improvising dowsing equipment and exploiting weaknesses. Better kits would include specialized ammunition for both killing monsters and dispelling their powers.

| 2      | A safe full of automatic and specialized weapons |

### General movement research

Many people tend to walk at about 1.4 metres per second (5.0 km/h; 3.1 mph; 4.6 ft/s).[1][2][3] Although many people are capable of walking at speeds upwards of 2.5 m/

The record was 44.72 km/h (27.78 mph), measured between meter 60 and meter 80 of the 100 meters sprint of the World Championships in Berlin on 16 August 2009 by Usain Bolt.[4][5] (Bolt's average speed over the course of this race was 37.58 km/h or 23.35 mph.)[6] Maximum human sprint speed is strikingly slower than that of many animals. Compared to other land animals, humans are exceptionally capable of endurance, but incapable of great speed.[7] Examples of animals with higher sprinting speeds include cheetahs which can attain short bursts of speed well over 100 km/h (62 mph),[8] the American quarter horse has topped 88 km/h (55 mph),[9] greyhounds can reach 70 km/h (43 mph), and the Mongolian wild ass has been measured at 64 km/h (40 mph).[10] Even the domestic cat may reach 48 km/h (30 mph).[10]

## Hiding

> There are hiding rules and I can't even parse them. "The way this works is that the seeker announces how long they are going to look in an area and makes an Intuition + Perception test. The hider makes an Intuition + Stealth test to determine how long the base time to find them would be, and that time is divided by the hits on the Seeker's Perception test to determine how long it would actually take them to find the hiding character." What? I'm not sure how you convert hider hits into a time (presumably using the time chart somehow). Then once you do that the time you get is divided into the base time based on how big the seeking zone is, which gives you the... I don't even know. Maybe it actually is a functional rule when you wargame it, but I don't know how to attempt to wargame it because there isn't a play example. There's a play example of how Potency affects your max stats, the most obvious thing in the world, but not for the most complexly written rule in the book. 

## Vehicles

> There's some vehicle rules, but just their speeds really. Hints about how to resolve shooting at a vehicle, or smash a car into a zombie, or things like that, none of those are there. Also the speeds are once again in moon speeds so I'd have to go get a conversion chart because I'm an Imperial dummy.  

## Wounds

> Wounds are next, even though they should really be closer to the "attacking" section. Like, immediately after the attacking section. So there's a geometric conversion chart, and the net wound level after soak determines how many boxes you fill in (0=>1, 1=>3, 2=>6, 3=>10, more=>all your boxes and you're bleeding to death). Also you always have 10 boxes. So, good enough, but kinda rocket tag. You might usually get 3 hits on soaking, but in a dice pool system you seriously might just get no hits at all, and then you're fucked cause that's all your boxes right there. Now, in an errata the thresholds were all bumped by +1, but still, you can be fine a few hits and then explode suddenly. Indomitability (one of the magic powers later) says that people with it "don't go unconscious" before you die. Incapacitated says that you might or might not be conscious... so is a heavily injured vampire Incapacitated but just always for sure still conscious? Or are they not even Incapacitated? Or what the hell is going on there?

# Cut bits to reuse:

## Organization

Rules governing these concepts are expressed differently in different Syndicates. For example, in the Makhzen, each of those three concepts is expressed as two separate "traditions". The Vow of Silence is the "Tradition of Lies" (basically: "Don't talk about fight club") and the "Tradition of Truth" (basically that you tell the creatures in the Syndicate - and _only_ them - what's going on and how things work). The concept of The Peace is the "Tradition of Hospitality" (that you let other supernatural creatures into your city and social circle) and the "Tradition of Hostility" (that killing supernatural creatures is a right and duty reserved to the Syndicate to be used against - and _only_ against - creatures that break the Traditions). And the concept of Respect gets broken up into the "Tradition of Accounting" (that every member is due the respect owed their status in the Syndicate) and the "Tradition of Domain" (which is basically the same thing, but includes the idea that the Princeps defines the rules and status within their domain). Other Syndicates use different formulations, but all of them cover those three concepts on way or another, because it's the essential glue that keeps supernatural society together.

### Guild of Psychopomps

Supposedly there was a guild of undertakers and embalmers founded by a Necromancer named Charon in the Shattered Empire back before it shattered. Since no one else believes that the Empire ever actually existed this history is not given a great deal of credence, even among the Order itself, but their mission seems consistent with that story regardless. The Guild of Psychopomps are experts in making sure that things that are supposed to be dead stay in Mictlan where they belong. Their long-standing antagonism with the Shattered Empire means that the very idea of that Empire is firmly counted among the things that are supposed to be _dead_.

The real problem that most people have with the Psychopomps is that they tend to extend this attitude to Revenants and Vampires, and sometimes even Animates, particularly the kind made from second-hand body parts. And while they haven't actively lead hunts against any of those, and seem to hypocritically have quite a few of the undead among their own ranks, they do have an annoying habit of _proselytizing_ a voluntary death or just permanent exile to the Gloom to these folks like unwelcome missionaries among the monsters. And they are suspected of getting reluctant targets around to their way of thinking by means fair or foul, up to and including blackmail or mind-control.

## Magic/Powers

#### Empty Body
As much of a curse as a power, the character become intangible (but not invisible). Things pass through the character unless they are made out of a substance that bypasses the resistances of the character, they are created by magic, or the character's powers are nullified generally. For example, a Bagheera with Empty Body could lift a silver fork or be shot by a silver bullet, or burned by the Walk of Flame, but could not open or be held back by a wooden door. Empty Body can be gained a second time, allowing the character to turn it on and off by spending five minutes and three Magic Points. Characters with Empty Body are always solid in the deeps of the world associated with their power source. While the character is insubstantial they can walk on any surface or no surface at all. Moving up or down vertically can be done, but is more work than walking along the floor or hovering at one level - it's kind of like climbing steep stairs.

#### The Familiar Stranger
When active, the character appears to each onlooker as if they were someone the onlooker expected to encounter, someone who "belongs" in the scene. This need not, and often will not be the same person for each onlooker. This power is subject to the normal limits of Veil, save that the character need not be at all familiar with any of the visages they assume.

#### Flesh Sculpting
TK self vs. others?

#### Soul Theft (... Play of Shadows)
steal something of a person through their shadow (memory/emotion/Fate/Magic Points?)


#### Blind the Senses
_Covert_

With a Simple Action, the character can remove a sense from a subject. The character makes an Intuition + Stealth or Logic + Larceny test against the target's Intuition. With at least one net hit, the subject loses the use of the sense for 5 minutes. Additional net hits increase the timeframe of the blinding (or deafening, or whatever). This action is covert, it is not obvious to anyone else that anything has happened (although it does detect as magic to dowsing).


#### Fictional Self 
_Enchantment, Sorcery_

**Cost:** 1 Magic Point

**Action:** Extended (1 hour), Intuition + Stealth or Charisma + Larceny

A character with Fictional Self can fool even magical detection. Making a successful Charisma + Stealth or Intuition + Medicine test, Fictional Self character can appear to feel, think, or be whatever they want others to perceive under mechanical or magical investigation (such as a lie detector or aura reading) unless the investigator gets more hits activating their power or device. Changing one's Fictional Self is a Complex action that costs a Magic Point, but continuing to have fake thoughts and emotions pass that are consistent with one's false existence requires no action at all.

#### Possession 
_Enchantment, Sorcery_

**Cost:** 3 Magic Points

**Action:** Complex, Willpower + Empathy or Logic + Persuasion vs. Willpower + Potency, net hits to duration (1 day)

Using Possession, the character can transfer their mind and spirit into the body of another. While the character is possessing a victim, their original body is inert and vulnerable, but they have full control of the other's body. They use the victim's Strength and Agility, but their own Social, Mental, and Special attributes as well as their own skills. They may use their own Powers in the body of another, and cannot activate any of the victim's Powers (but these disciplines do not necessarily turn off in the case of powers with ongoing effects). Activating Possession is a Complex action, and requires a successful opposed Willpower + Empathy or Logic + Persuasion against Willpower test. The character returns to their own body as soon as the sun rises or sets, the body they are in is knocked unconscious, their Possession power is suppressed by any means, or they spend a Complex Action to return to their own body. The character can only actually be in one body at a time.

#### Invisibility
_Blatant, Enchantment, Mutation, Sorcery_

**Cost:** 2 Magic Points

**Action:** Complex, automatic
 
The character can become fully invisible. Unlike most Guise powers, that's it: they're just completely transparent. This is powerful but not as convenient as one might think. The character still has a scent and heat signature, makes noise, and can be touched or detected with sonar. Nonetheless, targeting the character visually in combat increases the threshold by 2. Spilling paint, dust or water on them doesn't do much; such things count as being "carried" and vanish as if the character had picked them up, although this takes just long enough that coordinating attackers can target the momentarily visible character. Invisibility can be reflexively sustained into another scene for 1 Magic Point. As a Mutation, the ability to turn other objects invisible is much slower, taking hours or days.

#### Patience of the Mountains
_Passive_

The character does not age and need not eat, drink, or breathe. They persist night after night as the mountains and valleys do: never aging or decaying. Such a character can hold any position no matter how awkward without cramping or moving. They are immune to non-supernatural poison and disease. This ability is continuous. The character is still able to learn and change, and indeed Leviathan classically become substantially less human as time moves on. The one catch is that the character needs supernatural power to sustain themselves; if they do not regularly recharge according to their Power Schedule they will start to starve and wither (at a rate similar to mortal deprivation from food).

#### Undeath Eternal / Living Death
_Passive_

The character is one of the undead and shall never die (unless horribly killed). They have no real metabolism, and need not eat, drink, breathe, or sleep for their bodies to endure (although those that don't dream tend to go mad), and are effectively immune to most poisons and infections. Their hearts do not beat and their bodies take on ambient temperature. Without Revive the Flesh their wounds will not heal, but neither will they significantly bleed or fester.

#### The Flame Imperishable
_Passive_

The fire within the character burns eternally. Their soul is mangled by it, but their body will endure for all time. 


## Secrets of the Underworld
_TK_

TK

### Basic Secrets of the Underworld

#### Shallow Grave
_Enchantment, Sorcery_

**Cost:** 1 Magic Point

**Action:** Complex, automatic

In moments the character can merge themselves into earth or stone. The character needs a volume of natural earthen matter at least as large as their own body, but the only indication of their presence is a slight discoloration. While within their Shallow Grave the character is generally immune to a supernatural weakness that only reaches the surface of the material they rest in. Time in the Shallow Grave is generally peaceful and restful. The character may reflexively emerge at any time. For purposes of dispelling, Shallow Grave has 4 hits and also ends if the earth is sufficiently disturbed, but the character emerges unharmed in any case.

#### Threads in the Labyrinth
_Passive_

The character's sense of proprioception becomes absolute; they can retrace their steps no matter how looping or confused and always know their approximate depth and location unless moved while unconscious. Further, they can always tell if they are moving deeper into the Gloom or closer to Earth while in Mictlan.

#### Scent of Gold
_Enchantment, Sorcery_

**Cost:** -

**Action:** Simple, TK + TK or TK + TK

The character can open their senses of scent and taste to perfectly detect and identify minerals they are familiar with. The character can instantly tell if a coin is real gold with a touch of their tongue or sniff at a box or sample or soil to see if it may contain valuable ore.

### Advanced Secrets of the Underworld

#### Burrowing
_Blatant, Enchantment, Talent_

**Cost:** 1 Magic Point

**Action:** Simple, Strength + Survival or Strength + Artisan, threshold 0

The character can tunnel through earth or stone. The depth that a character can descend is equal to the number of hits in meters. Burrowing can be repeated in order to excavate tunnels in a hurry, and Troglodytes often use it for this purpose. It is up to the character whether they leave a hole behind themselves; if not the character can retrace their way back at no cost to emerge from their passage into the earth. Burrowing can only be dispelled while the character is digging or passing through the earth (in the later case, dispelling causes them to emerge where they entered); any tunnels left behind are normal spaces.

#### Transmutation
_Enchantment, Sorcery_

**Cost:** TK

**Action:** TK, Strength + Artisan or TK + TK

TK transform materials

#### One With the Earth
_Enchantment, Sorcery_

**Cost:** 1 Magic Point per Potency

**Action:** Extended, Strength + Survival or TK + TK

As in the legend of the Fischer King the character can form a bond with the Earth and share their power and vitality with it. The character must pour at least as many Magic Points into a collection of earth as their Potency to create the bond, but they store as much as much as their entire Power Reserve. When in contact with their bonded earth the character can draw upon stored Magic Points to fuel Fortitude powers or use their Fortitude powers to protect earth, stone, or metal connected with their bond, or draw out stored Magic Points in excess of their Potency at a rate of 1 per hour of rest upon the Earth. The bonded earth must be a least equal to the character's mass and volume, but may be moved if appropriately contained. Characters need not pay Magic Points to Burrow through bonded earth or merge with it using Shallow Grave. Characters may have have as many separate bonds created by One With the Earth as they have Potency.
