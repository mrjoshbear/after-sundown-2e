# Skills notes

"I like how (according to factor analysis) the modern quadrivium is culture, medicine, international politics, and computers."

# Rules not to miss

Supernatural creatures have the same power sources, and they are inherently resistant to  sorceries with the same power source as themselves (gaining a +3 bonus to any resistance test they are allowed).

# Fixes

Here's some highlights so far:
 * Potency is shit
 * Hiding is nonsense
 * Combat is rocket tag. I didn't even cover it at the time because Monsters hadn't been talked about yet, but two players in the same party are almost guaranteed to have wildly different Soak values, so creating encounters that are appropriate to a group is terrible.
 * The skills chapter is like 50% innuendo about what skills should do without concrete examples.
 * Backgrounds are nonsense
 * World demographics unclear
 * Needs better examples of what you'd want do to and why you'd want to do it. (yes I know there's a chapter called Character Options and Motivation that I've yet to get to. Spoilers: Estas malpli instiganta ol oni esperus.) 



There's rules for diving into cover, parting attacks, intercepting parting attacks... When you intercept a parting attack, "The threshold to strike the new target is unchanged.", and the threshold is 0 to hit someone fleeing and "non zero" to hit someone who's defending. So, I don't know which of those it's unchanged compared to. 

  Here's a fun fact, when I first used these rules, one player tried to throw a smoke grenade around another player. He got his attack off and all, and the grenade landed right where it should have. And then enemies went to shoot at that player. So, the player is in smoke "now", do they get the cover? I dunno. I mean there's no cover to dive for, they're already in cover. Does the player that threw the grenade roll the dive for cover check to see if they threw the grenade before the shots went off? Just a little gap in the rules that came up. Not even a thing you could predict would need to be in the rules ahead of time probably. 

There are hiding rules and I can't even parse them. "The way this works is that the seeker announces how long they are going to look in an area and makes an Intuition + Perception test. The hider makes an Intuition + Stealth test to determine how long the base time to find them would be, and that time is divided by the hits on the Seeker's Perception test to determine how long it would actually take them to find the hiding character." What? I'm not sure how you convert hider hits into a time (presumably using the time chart somehow). Then once you do that the time you get is divided into the base time based on how big the seeking zone is, which gives you the... I don't even know. Maybe it actually is a functional rule when you wargame it, but I don't know how to attempt to wargame it because there isn't a play example. There's a play example of how Potency affects your max stats, the most obvious thing in the world, but not for the most complexly written rule in the book. 


There's some vehicle rules, but just their speeds really. Hints about how to resolve shooting at a vehicle, or smash a car into a zombie, or things like that, none of those are there. Also the speeds are once again in moon speeds so I'd have to go get a conversion chart because I'm an Imperial dummy.  


Wounds are next, even though they should really be closer to the "attacking" section. Like, immediately after the attacking section. So there's a geometric conversion chart, and the net wound level after soak determines how many boxes you fill in (0=>1, 1=>3, 2=>6, 3=>10, more=>all your boxes and you're bleeding to death). Also you always have 10 boxes. So, good enough, but kinda rocket tag. You might usually get 3 hits on soaking, but in a dice pool system you seriously might just get no hits at all, and then you're fucked cause that's all your boxes right there. Now, in an errata the thresholds were all bumped by +1, but still, you can be fine a few hits and then explode suddenly. Indomitability (one of the magic powers later) says that people with it "don't go unconscious" before you die. Incapacitated says that you might or might not be conscious... so is a heavily injured vampire Incapacitated but just always for sure still conscious? Or are they not even Incapacitated? Or what the hell is going on there? 

Special ammo in shotguns can let them dispel magic from very far off, but it doesn't say if an auto-shotgun can get its +3 dice to the dispelling. Pretty cool if so. 


There's Crossbows, but not Bows. What the hell is up with that part. 

Oh, yeah, and you can get silencers, but they only work for "five shots", which probably means five attack rolls, but it's hard to know since it's not one bullet per attack roll. Either way they should probably last more like hundreds of shots at minimum. I only know what a quick googling tells me, but "five" seems pretty fake. Also they "reduce" the noise, but in a sort of vague and unspecified way. It's not like, "+2 threshold to hear the shot". In fact there are no specific rules for hearing gunshots at various ranges anyway. Which normally I wouldn't mind, if you just forgot about the issue entirely, but when you've put in a paragraph on silencers you've obviously considered the issue and then dropped half of it. 

Throwing Things is easy to understand, as is Damage Over Time. Then we get to Other Hazards which means Falling, Shock, and Poison. You might expect "fires" to be in there too, but that's covered as a DOT. Really, DOT should probably have two or three times as many examples as it does. Falling is easy to remember (even the chart is easy to remember), and Electrocution is also easy to remember. Poison is... less easy. It's one of those "big random chart" types of deals. 

So poison is a DOT, but it also has a Timer that will eventually run out, and then when you take extra doses you either bump up the timer or you leave it alone and cut the delay. And then poison counters can either cut the Timer value or increase the Delay value. And then once at least one box of damage has been inflicted, most poisons have a secondary effect that triggers. It's not even hard to resolve exactly, it's just a lot of fiddly numbers, and like half the monsters are immune to poisons, which means that you'll learn these rules relatively rarely probably, and then you'll probably have to look it up each time. 

 I'd love to see Sabotage merged with Rigging and then a Science skill added into the game. Specializations like Physics, Biology, Archeology, etc. You don't fight with a Soldier background, so you probably shouldn't do sciency things with just a science background. A science related background would be that you work at a university and have accreditation and stuff like that. And, of course, you might even be some sort of hack professor where you have a background but not enough science skill ranks to actually back it up. 

  I've played in a game with a Perception stat but not a "notice things" skill on top of it (Earthdawn 1e) and it's dumb feeling most of the time. If Perception becomes a stat in place of some other stat, you'll just need an Awareness skill in its place. You're just repainting a bikeshed at that point I think, unless it's part of some larger design revolution. 


# Cut bits to reuse:

## Organization of the Damned


The Covenant maintains a number of parallel hierarchies in addition to the primary one. Rather than being a bishop or priest (which is regional), one could be Apostolic Exarch (which governs a region that is not under Covenant Control), a Military Ordinal (which handles defense of the order regardless of location), or a Palatine (which is organizational and has personnel but no fixed territory). All of these titles carry approximately the same weight as Bishop. The Covenant also recognizes some of its members as "saints". Once a Covenant member has descended into sainthood they carry a status that _cannot be taken away_, which essentially allows them to speak and be listened to on any issue by any church conclave at any organizational level. Since the membership of the Covenant are supernatural in nature, the requirements of miraculous activities is entirely a formality and being recognized by the Anti-Pope as a Saint is entirely political. Saints are given spiffy blood red uniforms when they serve in any official capacity and are thence known as Sanguines regardless of their rank or duties.


The Cauchemar message appeals to the young (which in supernatural terms means those born or made in the last 400 years or so), and campaigns for the removal of traditional privileges for the ancient and established monsters of the world. The Communes favor change and a new way of doing things modeled upon human reforms, but that's about as far as they go in agreeing with one another. It is easy to get the distributed Communes apparatus to help tear down something or turn upon a criminal, but relatively difficult to pass effective resolutions. The ideological divides amongst the Revolutionary Committee are fierce and hard drawn, so the group as a whole acts rarely and with much debate on matters of anything but immediate survival.

## Magic/Powers

(into Secrets of the Earth?)
**Burrowing** By spending a power point, the character can tunnel into earth or stone. It is up to the character whether they leave a hole behind themselves. The depth that a character can descend is equal to the number of hits on a Strength + Survival or Strength + Larceny test in meters. The character can emerge without spending power. Burrowing can be repeated in order to excavate tunnels in a hurry, and Troglodytes often use it for this purpose. If no hole is left behind them, the ground will simply have a slight discoloration, the actual form of the terrain will be unharmed. Such spots radiate magic of the type of the creature hidden inside them.

**Chain of Eyes** The character can choose two or more creatures they can perceive and allow one or more of the chosen creatures to perceive what one or more other chosen creatures can perceive. With a Simple Action and a power point, the character can add a creature they can perceive to the chain. However many creatures are in the chain, the character can decide which creatures in the chain can voyeuristically leech off the senses of which other creatures in the chain. The character can change that list as a Free Action at any time. Creatures unused to receiving sense data directly into their mind by magic power may become confused. Activating the Chain of Eyes requires an Intuition + Operations or Intuition + Tactics test, one hit establishes it with a base timeframe of 10 minutes, and net hits can increase the timeframe.

**Empty Body** As much of a curse as a power, the character become intangible (but not invisible). Things pass through the character unless they are made out of a substance that bypasses the resistances of the character, they are created by magic, or the character's powers are nullified generally. For example, a Bagheera with Empty Body could lift a silver fork or be shot by a silver bullet, or burned by the Walk of Flame, but could not open or be held back by a wooden door. Empty Body can be gained a second time, allowing the character to turn it on and off by spending five minutes and three power points. Characters with Empty Body are always solid in the deeps of the world associated with their power source. While the character is insubstantial they can walk on any surface or no surface at all. Moving up or down vertically can be done, but is more work than walking along the floor or hovering at one level - it's kind of like climbing steep stairs.

(adapt into Magnetism)
**Desire Reflection** By spending a power point, the character can appear as whoever or whatever someone else would respond most favorably to until the end of the scene. This is subject to the normal limits of Veil, and thus without having Vanish From the Mind's Eye the character must content themselves with activating it whilst unobserved and then appearing as the object of desire for the first person who sees them. _With_ Vanish From the Mind's Eye, the character may select any person they can perceive and appear as the object of their desire. This ability uses Charisma + Empathy or Intuition + Larceny, and may be enough to provoke a Loneliness or Greed Frenzy.

**The Familiar Stranger** When active, the character appears to each onlooker as if they were someone the onlooker expected to encounter, someone who "belongs" in the scene. This need not, and often will not be the same person for each onlooker. This power is subject to the normal limits of Veil, save that the character need not be at all familiar with any of the visages they assume.

**Phantasmagoria**
_"You're eating maggots Michael, how do they taste?"__
By spending two power points and a Complex Action, the character can make a magical illusion that fools recording devices and the senses of creatures. The character can control the vertical, the horizontal, and the audio within the area. The illusion extends to a column with a 3m radius and height per point of Potency, and it can be moved at any speed out to an area in line of sight by spending a Simple Action per round. The Illusion's contents can be changed to apparently react to events reactively so long as the character can see their own illusion and cares. The realistic nature (or not) of the illusion is determined by an Intuition + Artisan or Charisma + Expression test. Characters can spot the weirdness with an appropriate skill (usually Intuition + Empathy or Intuition + Perception). The Illusion normally ends at the end of the scene, but for another power point, the character can leave an Illusion standing until the next sunrise, but binding an Illusion like this makes it unable to be moved (though it can still react to apparent stimuli so long as it remains in its defined area).

#### Blind the Senses
_Covert_

With a Simple Action, the character can remove a sense from a subject. The character makes an Intuition + Stealth or Logic + Larceny test against the target's Intuition. With at least one net hit, the subject loses the use of the sense for 5 minutes. Additional net hits increase the timeframe of the blinding (or deafening, or whatever). This action is covert, it is not obvious to anyone else that anything has happened (although it does detect as magic to dowsing).
