Many people tend to walk at about 1.4 metres per second (5.0 km/h; 3.1 mph; 4.6 ft/s).[1][2][3] Although many people are capable of walking at speeds upwards of 2.5 m/

The record was 44.72 km/h (27.78 mph), measured between meter 60 and meter 80 of the 100 meters sprint of the World Championships in Berlin on 16 August 2009 by Usain Bolt.[4][5] (Bolt's average speed over the course of this race was 37.58 km/h or 23.35 mph.)[6] Maximum human sprint speed is strikingly slower than that of many animals. Compared to other land animals, humans are exceptionally capable of endurance, but incapable of great speed.[7] Examples of animals with higher sprinting speeds include cheetahs which can attain short bursts of speed well over 100 km/h (62 mph),[8] the American quarter horse has topped 88 km/h (55 mph),[9] greyhounds can reach 70 km/h (43 mph), and the Mongolian wild ass has been measured at 64 km/h (40 mph).[10] Even the domestic cat may reach 48 km/h (30 mph).[10]

## Hiding

There are hiding rules and I can't even parse them. "The way this works is that the seeker announces how long they are going to look in an area and makes an Intuition + Perception test. The hider makes an Intuition + Stealth test to determine how long the base time to find them would be, and that time is divided by the hits on the Seeker's Perception test to determine how long it would actually take them to find the hiding character." What? I'm not sure how you convert hider hits into a time (presumably using the time chart somehow). Then once you do that the time you get is divided into the base time based on how big the seeking zone is, which gives you the... I don't even know. Maybe it actually is a functional rule when you wargame it, but I don't know how to attempt to wargame it because there isn't a play example. There's a play example of how Potency affects your max stats, the most obvious thing in the world, but not for the most complexly written rule in the book. 

## Vehicles

There's some vehicle rules, but just their speeds really. Hints about how to resolve shooting at a vehicle, or smash a car into a zombie, or things like that, none of those are there. Also the speeds are once again in moon speeds so I'd have to go get a conversion chart because I'm an Imperial dummy.  

## Wounds

Wounds are next, even though they should really be closer to the "attacking" section. Like, immediately after the attacking section. So there's a geometric conversion chart, and the net wound level after soak determines how many boxes you fill in (0=>1, 1=>3, 2=>6, 3=>10, more=>all your boxes and you're bleeding to death). Also you always have 10 boxes. So, good enough, but kinda rocket tag. You might usually get 3 hits on soaking, but in a dice pool system you seriously might just get no hits at all, and then you're fucked cause that's all your boxes right there. Now, in an errata the thresholds were all bumped by +1, but still, you can be fine a few hits and then explode suddenly. Indomitability (one of the magic powers later) says that people with it "don't go unconscious" before you die. Incapacitated says that you might or might not be conscious... so is a heavily injured vampire Incapacitated but just always for sure still conscious? Or are they not even Incapacitated? Or what the hell is going on there? 

# Cut bits to reuse:

## Organization of the Damned

The Covenant maintains a number of parallel hierarchies in addition to the primary one. Rather than being a bishop or priest (which is regional), one could be Apostolic Exarch (which governs a region that is not under Covenant Control), a Military Ordinal (which handles defense of the order regardless of location), or a Palatine (which is organizational and has personnel but no fixed territory). All of these titles carry approximately the same weight as Bishop. The Covenant also recognizes some of its members as "saints". Once a Covenant member has descended into sainthood they carry a status that _cannot be taken away_, which essentially allows them to speak and be listened to on any issue by any church conclave at any organizational level. Since the membership of the Covenant are supernatural in nature, the requirements of miraculous activities is entirely a formality and being recognized by the Anti-Pope as a Saint is entirely political. Saints are given spiffy blood red uniforms when they serve in any official capacity and are thence known as Sanguines regardless of their rank or duties.


The Cauchemar message appeals to the young (which in supernatural terms means those born or made in the last 400 years or so), and campaigns for the removal of traditional privileges for the ancient and established monsters of the world. The Communes favor change and a new way of doing things modeled upon human reforms, but that's about as far as they go in agreeing with one another. It is easy to get the distributed Communes apparatus to help tear down something or turn upon a criminal, but relatively difficult to pass effective resolutions. The ideological divides amongst the Revolutionary Committee are fierce and hard drawn, so the group as a whole acts rarely and with much debate on matters of anything but immediate survival.

## Magic/Powers

**Chain of Eyes** The character can choose two or more creatures they can perceive and allow one or more of the chosen creatures to perceive what one or more other chosen creatures can perceive. With a Simple Action and a power point, the character can add a creature they can perceive to the chain. However many creatures are in the chain, the character can decide which creatures in the chain can voyeuristically leech off the senses of which other creatures in the chain. The character can change that list as a Free Action at any time. Creatures unused to receiving sense data directly into their mind by magic power may become confused. Activating the Chain of Eyes requires an Intuition + Operations or Intuition + Tactics test, one hit establishes it with a base timeframe of 10 minutes, and net hits can increase the timeframe.

**Empty Body** As much of a curse as a power, the character become intangible (but not invisible). Things pass through the character unless they are made out of a substance that bypasses the resistances of the character, they are created by magic, or the character's powers are nullified generally. For example, a Bagheera with Empty Body could lift a silver fork or be shot by a silver bullet, or burned by the Walk of Flame, but could not open or be held back by a wooden door. Empty Body can be gained a second time, allowing the character to turn it on and off by spending five minutes and three power points. Characters with Empty Body are always solid in the deeps of the world associated with their power source. While the character is insubstantial they can walk on any surface or no surface at all. Moving up or down vertically can be done, but is more work than walking along the floor or hovering at one level - it's kind of like climbing steep stairs.

**The Familiar Stranger** When active, the character appears to each onlooker as if they were someone the onlooker expected to encounter, someone who "belongs" in the scene. This need not, and often will not be the same person for each onlooker. This power is subject to the normal limits of Veil, save that the character need not be at all familiar with any of the visages they assume.

**Phantasmagoria**
_"You're eating maggots Michael, how do they taste?"__
By spending two power points and a Complex Action, the character can make a magical illusion that fools recording devices and the senses of creatures. The character can control the vertical, the horizontal, and the audio within the area. The illusion extends to a column with a 3m radius and height per point of Potency, and it can be moved at any speed out to an area in line of sight by spending a Simple Action per round. The Illusion's contents can be changed to apparently react to events reactively so long as the character can see their own illusion and cares. The realistic nature (or not) of the illusion is determined by an Intuition + Artisan or Charisma + Expression test. Characters can spot the weirdness with an appropriate skill (usually Intuition + Empathy or Intuition + Perception). The Illusion normally ends at the end of the scene, but for another power point, the character can leave an Illusion standing until the next sunrise, but binding an Illusion like this makes it unable to be moved (though it can still react to apparent stimuli so long as it remains in its defined area).


#### Blind the Senses
_Covert_

With a Simple Action, the character can remove a sense from a subject. The character makes an Intuition + Stealth or Logic + Larceny test against the target's Intuition. With at least one net hit, the subject loses the use of the sense for 5 minutes. Additional net hits increase the timeframe of the blinding (or deafening, or whatever). This action is covert, it is not obvious to anyone else that anything has happened (although it does detect as magic to dowsing).


## Water/Seas TK

#### TK Breathe and Move in Water

#### TK Liquid in Lungs / Drowning Doom

#### TK

#### Prison of Ice

The character creates ice sufficient to hold someone in place or build something out of. By spending a power point and a complex action, the character can create a cubic meter of ice within 10 meters of themselves. The ice can be in any shape, forms instantly, and can cover someone's wrists, feet, or even mouth. The character can make a Logic + Artisan or Charisma + Expression test to improve the workmanship and solidity of the ice. Once created, the ice is real ice and cannot be dispelled.


#### Water Prison
_Blatant, Enchantment, Sorcery_

**Cost:** 1 Power Point

**Action:** Complex, Agility + Combat or Willpower + Rigging grabbing attack

At the character's command water can be manipulated into three dimensional shapes that hold their form and are strong as steel. Actually capturing someone with the titular prison made of water requires a that the target be within Short range of sufficient water and is resolved as a grab attack, albeit at range. Grasping water has an effective Strength equal to the character's Willpower. A character held by Water Prison is considered fully wet for purposes of magical weaknesses to water.


#### Fictional Self 
_Enchantment, Sorcery_

**Cost:** 1 Power Point

**Action:** Extended (1 hour), Intuition + Stealth or Charisma + Larceny

A character with Fictional Self can fool even magical detection. Making a successful Charisma + Stealth or Intuition + Medicine test, Fictional Self character can appear to feel, think, or be whatever they want others to perceive under mechanical or magical investigation (such as a lie detector or aura reading) unless the investigator gets more hits activating their power or device. Changing one's Fictional Self is a Complex action that costs a power point, but continuing to have fake thoughts and emotions pass that are consistent with one's false existence requires no action at all.


#### Possession 
_Enchantment, Sorcery_

**Cost:** 3 Power Points

**Action:** Complex, Willpower + Empathy or Logic + Persuasion vs. Willpower + Potency, net hits to duration (1 day)

Using Possession, the character can transfer their mind and spirit into the body of another. While the character is possessing a victim, their original body is inert and vulnerable, but they have full control of the other's body. They use the victim's Strength and Agility, but their own Social, Mental, and Special attributes as well as their own skills. They may use their own Powers in the body of another, and cannot activate any of the victim's Powers (but these disciplines do not necessarily turn off in the case of powers with ongoing effects). Activating Possession is a Complex action, and requires a successful opposed Willpower + Empathy or Logic + Persuasion against Willpower test. The character returns to their own body as soon as the sun rises or sets, the body they are in is knocked unconscious, their Possession power is suppressed by any means, or they spend a Complex Action to return to their own body. The character can only actually be in one body at a time.


#### Invisibility
_Blatant, Enchantment, Mutation, Sorcery_

**Cost:** 2 Power Points

**Action:** Complex, automatic
 
The character can become fully invisible. Unlike most Guise powers, that's it: they're just completely transparent. This is powerful but not as convenient as one might think. The character still has a scent and heat signature, makes noise, and can be touched or detected with sonar. Nonetheless, targeting the character visually in combat increases the threshold by 2. Spilling paint, dust or water on them doesn't do much; such things count as being "carried" and vanish as if the character had picked them up, although this takes just long enough that coordinating attackers can target the momentarily visible character. Invisibility can be reflexively sustained into another scene for 1 Power Point. As a Mutation, the ability to turn other objects invisible is much slower, taking hours or days.



#### Patience of the Mountains
_Passive_

The character does not age and need not eat, drink, or breathe. They persist night after night as the mountains and valleys do: never aging or decaying. Such a character can hold any position no matter how awkward without cramping or moving. They are immune to non-supernatural poison and disease. This ability is continuous. The character is still able to learn and change, and indeed Leviathan classically become substantially less human as time moves on. The one catch is that the character needs supernatural power to sustain themselves; if they do not regularly recharge according to their Power Schedule they will start to starve and wither (at a rate similar to mortal deprivation from food).

#### Undeath Eternal
_Passive_

The character is one of the living dead, and shall never die (unless horribly killed). They have no real metabolism, and need not eat, drink, breathe, or sleep for their bodies to endure (although those that don't dream tend to go mad), and are effectively immune to most poisons and infections. Their hearts do not beat and their bodies take on ambient temperature. Without Revive the Flesh their wounds will not heal, but neither will they significantly bleed or fester.



## Spark of Knowledge

Spark of Knowledge only applies to complex, artificial things; it has no power to work on bodies or natural things, but moreover it has no power over the simplest of machines. In general, an object must have multiple moving parts, electrical circuits, or a significant amount of information (more than a tweet) to be a target of the powers in this discipline.

### Basic Spark of Knowledge

#### Osmosis
_Sorcery_

**Cost:** -

**Action:** Extended (variable), Logic + Research or Logic + Operations, net hits to timescale

The character can absorb knowledge and information from an object just by touching it. The base time of the action is the same as would be normally required to view the information contained, but net hits may reduce the timescale far beyond what would normally be physically possible, so the point of instantaneously becoming part of the character's memory with enough hits. The character may also hold an object to consult it in real time as an automatic Free Action, a bit like having a teleprompter. Osmosis works just as well on books and other physical records as digital devices, but while it smooths over encoding difficulties it still requires the character to have the appropriate Languages or other Backgrounds to contextualize the information contained.

#### Panopticon
_Enchantment, Sorcery_

**Cost:** -

**Action:** Simple, Logic + Electronics or Logic + Operations

The character can treat sensors as extensions of their own natural senses. Without TK the character must touch a device to shift to perceive through it, but once established they may shift their perception into other connected devices with a Simple action. It is also possible to spread their their senses over multiple sensors, but doing so quickly becomes overwhelming, as does any stimulation that overloads a sensor's output, as if they character were subject to _overstimulation_.

#### Spanner in the Works
_Enchantment, Sorcery, Subtle_

**Cost:** -

**Action:** Simple, Logic + Sabotage or Logic + Rigging



### Advanced Spark of Knowledge

#### Ghost in the Machine
_Enchantment, Sorcery_

**Cost:** -

**Action:** Free, automatic

TK / operate machinery

#### Maximum Overdrive / Redline

#### TK
_Passive_

The character no longer needs to touch artifacts to use Spark of Knowledge and can apply their powers to any object they can perceive.


## Sea of Stars

### Basic Sea of Stars

#### Abyssal Grace
_Passive_

The character's body adapts automatically to the extremes of the ocean depths and empty space alike. Broad pressure, whether in total absence or crushing abundance, has no adverse affect. Without other powers the character still requires breath, but at only one tenth the normal rate and with the ability to inhale liquids and extract oxygen from them with no more difficulty than air. The extremes of mountain air make no difference to them at all. The character gains 6 points of armor with regard to heat and cold. Finally, they experience no penalty for moving in water or free fall. Abyssal Grace otherwise does not protect a character from the effects of a weakness to water or sunlight.

#### Measure the Stars
_Sorcery_

TK calculation, measurement, navigation

### Advanced Sea of Stars

#### Drowning Doom
_Blatant, Enchantment, Sorcery_

**Cost:** 1 Power Point

**Action:** Simple, TK vs. Strength

With a dismissive gesture the character robs their target of breath and speech. The target's lungs (or parallel organs) are filled with water or collapsed with vacuum at the character's option. In most circumstances this arrests their ability to effectively speak and causes them to begin drowning; Abyssal Grace gives total immunity to Drowning Doom, and characters that do not otherwise need to breathe will still not drown.

#### Water Prison
_Blatant, Enchantment, Sorcery_

**Cost:** 1 Power Point

**Action:** Complex, Agility + Combat or Willpower + Rigging grabbing attack

At the character's command water or ice can be manipulated into three dimensional shapes that hold their form and are strong as steel. Actually capturing someone with the titular prison made of water requires a that the target be within Short range of sufficient water and is resolved as a grab attack, albeit at range. Grasping water has an effective Strength equal to the character's Willpower. A character held by Water Prison is considered fully wet for purposes of magical weaknesses to water.
