# Running the Game

After Sundown is a collaborative storytelling game, where all the players except one take the roles of the protagonists in an ensemble story set in the realm of horror. The odd player out is the MC, who acts as narrator, director, and actor of last resort for all the other characters in the story. The MC has substantial leeway in interpreting how events unfold and is responsible for much of the writing of the backstory. Nevertheless, the story is still _about_ the player characters, and no one should forget that.

Player characters will have numbers and abilities written on a character sheet that demonstrate what they are capable of, but in most cases the players themselves will determine what their character actually does. When actions are declared, dice are often rolled to determine the results of the action. But when that is not enough (or would be too tedious as is the case for many minor actions), the MC can deterministically assign results.

Actual stories are told cooperatively, with players bringing up events relevant to their character's backstory and possibilities for the MC to consider weaving into the ongoing description of the world and having real solid first person narrative control over the actions and dialog of their player character. The MC is sometimes said to be "running" the game, because they provide the narrative control on the stage where the protagonists act.

## Basic Dice Mechanics

When you perform an action, you roll a pile of d6s called a _Dicepool_. Dice which come up as a 5 or 6 are _Hits_. A task's required number of hits is its _Threshold_. Any hits gained in addition to that are _Net Hits_. If a die roll generates enough hits the attempt is a success, otherwise it's a failure.

**Dicepools:** Your dicepool is generally speaking a pile of d6s with dice equal to your character's Attribute + Skill, and circumstantial modifiers increase or decrease the number of dice rolled. A human's attributes and skills go up to 9. A supernatural creature's can go up higher than that because their Potency increases their Attribute maximums. As such, it is expected that supernatural critters will roll more dice on actions that their powers apply to than normal humans do.

The effects one can expect out of getting a number of Hits are proportionately more awesome as the number of hits increases:

| Hits | Awesomeness |
|:----:|:------------|
| 0 | Not Awesome. Tying shoes, climbing stairs. |
| 1 | Completely Pedestrian. Driving a car, throwing Darts. |
| 2 | Ordinary. Driving in the rain, hitting a bullseye at the range|
| 3 | Professional. Don't try this at home. Formula One racing, surgery |
| 4 | Hard. Don't try this at all. Movie stunts, brain surgery |
| 5 | Extreme. |
| 6 | Crazy Extreme. |
| 7 | Super Human. Does not need disclaimers because it is clearly impossible. |

**Resistance Tests:** Sometimes a character will be allowed to _resist_ something being done to them. This is done by rolling dice like normal, save that rather than generating an awesome result, the character is merely reducing the number of hits against them, making whatever is being done to them take less or even no effect. In general, a Physical Resistance Test is simply a Strength roll, a Mental Resistance Test is an Intuition roll, and a Social Resistance Test is a Willpower roll. If a character has an Edge score, it is added to these Resistance tests. When a character is struck with an attack they may be called upon to make a Soak roll, which is a special kind of Physical Resistance Test that also adds their appropriate Armor value to the roll (if any). In most cases, if the Resistance Test reduces the number of hits on a test to zero or less, the original attempt has failed.

**Predictable Failure:** Sometimes a character will be struggling under enough penalties that they don't have a dice pool at all. In these instances, the character is going to get zero hits, which means that absolutely nothing they do will be awesome. They can still stagger down the corridor or open a door, but as soon as a stunt requires even one hit they are going to fail unless they are a Luminary who can spend Edge on the problem to get some dice and a chance.

**Extended Tests:** Some actions take an expected amount of time. If a character gets the requisite number of hits, they succeed in the expected amount of time. If they get more than the requisite number of hits, they may complete the task well ahead of schedule. For every hit made in excess of the minimum, move to the next lower amount of time on the time chart. If a character fails to succeed, they may retry, but only after having put in the normal time into the first shot. So for example: Mina is attempting to paint a house (Strength + Artisan, 1, 2 days) and gets 3 hits. Since she got 2 more hits than she needed, she can go to the next lower time period twice, bringing the time frame down to five hours.

Century, Decade, Year, Season, Month, Week, 3 Days, 1 Day, 5 Hours, 1 Hour, 20 minutes, 5 Minutes, 1 Minute, 1 Round, Simple Action, Free Action

**Team Work:** When more than one character throws their weight into a project they can achieve results that are more awesome and in less time than what either character could achieve alone. However, the game mechanics completely break down if you just add the dicepool of one character to another. What is done instead is that whichever character has the best dicepool is considered the main acting character, and the other characters are considered the assisting characters. Each assisting character makes their check, and each hit is added as a bonus die on the main character's test. Since characters get about 1 hit per three dice, on average improving the awesomeness of a task is "hard" (threshold 3). In many cases an MC will allow a character to assist with a tangential but vaguely related skill (and in such cases it is entirely possible for one of the assisting characters to roll more dice than the main acting character).

Too many cooks spoil the broth. How many characters qualify as "too many" is unfortunately a very fluid concept that depends a lot on what you're doing. Sometimes there are real physical limits to how many people can literally fit around a project, and other times it's procedural. In general, most teamwork projects should be handled with five or less people. A project larger than that should probably be split into multiple tests, although at the MC's discretion there may be exceptions. A good set of management protocols is essential for most group projects to move forward. Most of the time, no more assisting characters can work on a project than the highest Tactics skill of the characters. The character providing the tactics skill allowing multiple characters to work on the project need not be the main acting character, and often will not be.

## Character Creation
_Scene opens on a ringing cellular phone. Camera pans back to reveal..._

Characters in After Sundown run the gamut of power. Normal human extras are slaughtered in groups by monsters run amok in the fine tradition of slasher movies the world over. And yet even those monsters live in terror of even larger monsters from the ancient past. It can best be thought of in terms of regular horror movies going on simultaneously with the events from [Hellboy](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0167190/) or [Queen of the Damned](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0238546/). The Characters are created at a point just before the story starts. And thus, the point where the characters begin is dependent upon what kind of story is being told:

* **The Origin Story:** The characters begin with little or no knowledge of the supernatural as human Luminaries. Over the course of the story they discover magical powers within themselves, attain magical powers, or simply come into conflict with supernatural agents.
* **The In Medias Res Adventure:** The characters begin having already been supernatural creatures for some time. They have come to terms with what they are, they have made social connections amongst other supernatural creatures, and they are already members of supernatural organizations. Alternatively, they may be mortals that have successfully hunted supernatural creatures, and have extraordinary, if still mundane, abilities that indicate that success.
* **The Power Fantasy:** The characters begin already powerful within the context of supernatural society. Each character is a thing to be feared, whose name is uttered in whispered tones by creatures who themselves inspire fear in mortal hearts.

Regardless of what kind of story is being told, remember that it is going to be an ensemble cast with each player's character being one of the story driving protagonists. Each character thus should have interests and goals that drive the plot forward, not just passive interests or reactive interests. It's fine for a character to be a doctor or a police officer, but they can't just be a passive observer waiting for people to get sick or cars to be reported stolen. A character worth playing thus needs to have a goal that they can work towards when there _isn't_ a fire to be put out. It's fine to play a character who can heal others, but the character _needs_ a hook that can get them motivated to pursue goals and advance the plot when there isn't anyone injured in their presence.

### Characters for an Origin Story
_Don't be silly, there's no such thing as vampires._

In an Origin Story, the characters are, or at least _believe themselves_ to be mortal humans. As such, the player creates their character as if they were a mortal human Luminary. Generally over the course of the story, the player characters will be embraced by vampires, mauled by werewolves, or even discover that their memories of growing up in Indiana are digital imprints and they've been a robot the entire time. But becoming cursed with magic powers or discovering that they have had them all along is something that doesn't happen until after character generation. This makes characters who are substantially better than normal humans and makes sure that they have a diverse set of competencies. They _are_ the Protagonists, after all.

#### Attributes

All of a character's attributes start at 4. The player then prioritizes their Physical, Mental, and Social attributes, distributing 1 point to one pair, 3 points to another pair and 5 points to the last pair. Then they get 2 additional points that they can place anywhere they want. An individual attribute cannot be higher than 6 on character creation.
Luminaries begin the game with an Edge of 3.

#### Active Skills

A character's Active Skills start at zero. The player then prioritizes their Physical, Social, and Technical skills, distributing 11 points to one set, 16 points to the next set, and 21 points to the last set. Then they get 6 points they can place anywhere they want. An individual skill cannot be higher than 6 on character creation. The character then chooses three skill specializations. Remember that they also gain a specialization for each Technical skill they have trained.

#### Backgrounds

A character starts with 27 points of Backgrounds. No Background can start higher than rating 6. An important thing to note is that a character in an Origin Story has a job, some social networks and maybe a family. They almost certainly _don't_ have Backgrounds like "Makhzen Society" or "Black Spot Ethos." 

#### Resources

The player chooses one 3-point Resource, one 2-point Resource, and one 1-point Resource. At the MC's discretion, a player may be able to buy more Resources with Obligations. Mortal humans are not normally able to take Destiny or Secrets.

#### Motivations

Human characters do not normally have Master Passions. However, they still do have Driving Passions and Ethical Taboos. So the player should define some for their character. The player should really think about what their character wants, and what their character is willing to do to get what they want.

#### Advantages and Disadvantages

Characters can have Advantages and Disadvantages, but the number of the one should equal the number of the other.

#### Magical Transformation

Sometimes players will want to skip the portion of body horror that goes with actually transforming into a supernatural creature. In these cases the characters can have their transformations already applied, and then tell the origin story of the characters being introduced to supernatural society.

### Characters for an In Medias Res story
_Whether you like it or not, you're in the middle of a war that has been raging for the better part of a thousand years._

In Medias Res is the storytelling technique of beginning the narration in the middle of the action. It can be exciting and engrossing, and can lead to greater audience attention, especially if the origin story is somewhat tangential to the primary events of the story. Sometimes the story will go back in flashbacks to produce the past events that led to the circumstances with which the story began like in [Pulp Fiction](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110912/) or [Memento](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0209144/), and other times the action will simply continue towards conclusion like [Ocean's Eleven](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0240772/) or [Three Kings](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120188/). In any case, those are all solid pieces of In Medias Res storytelling and you should watch those movies if you haven't already.

Characters for an In Medias Res story begin with all the introductions to supernatural society well out of the way. They are already known by and cognizant of the major Syndicates and they already have membership in a cult (if they want one) and have come to an understanding of the basic score of the horror-inspired world they live (or at least persist) in. They are supernatural creatures themselves, and have been that way for long enough that neither using their powers nor seeing others use their powers actually surprises them any more. An In Medias Res story is a good place to start for groups that want to tell stories about events _in_ the realm of horror rather than ones exploring their characters' reactions _to_ the realm of horror, and as such it is considered the default game.

Sometimes players will want to play "monster hunters" rather than supernatural creatures. For an In Medias Res story about Van Helsings, Watchers, and Whistlers, it is plausible to begin the story where the characters are _not_ magical creatures and are instead badass human Luminaries fighting _against_ the supernatural monsters of the week. In such a case the characters don't start with a supernatural type or any Powers, but they still may well have Resources and Backgrounds dealing with the occult because in an In Medias Res story, the hunters have already done this sort of thing at some point in the past.

#### Attributes

All of a character's attributes start at 4. The player then prioritizes their Physical, Mental, and Social attributes, distributing 2 points to one pair, 4 points to another pair and 5 points to the last pair. Then they get 3 additional points that they can place anywhere they want. An individual attribute cannot be higher than 7 on character creation.
Monstrous Luminaries begin the game with an Edge of 3. The character has a Potency of 2 and therefore a Power Reserve of 13.
Hunters get an Edge of 4 and an increase of two other Attributes of their choice. However, they have no Potency stat, so their attribute maximums are still 6 and they have no Power Reserve.

#### Active Skills

A character's Active Skills start at zero. The player then prioritizes their Physical, Social, and Technical skills, distributing 14 points to one set, 19 points to the second set, and 24 points to the last set. Then they get 6 points they can place anywhere they want. An individual skill cannot be higher than 6 on character creation (or 7 for Hunters, due to their additional Edge). The character then chooses four skill specializations. Remember that they also gain a specialization for each Technical skill they have trained.

#### Backgrounds

A character starts with 35 points of Backgrounds. No Background can start higher than rating 6. It is entirely reasonable for a character to have been out of mortal society long enough that they don't have any "Corporate Culture" or "Service Work" type Backgrounds. On the other hand, it's equally plausible for such a character to have been keeping up appearances in the mortal world (or even being involved in mortal affairs when the story begins) and thus have such Backgrounds. Mixing characters who don't know how to handle themselves in a 7-11 with streetwise modernists in the same Band can be a good roleplaying hook.

#### Resources

The player chooses one 3-point Resource, two 2-point Resources, and one 1-point Resource. The player must take an Obligation of rating 3 or less, but they get to buy an extra Resource for taking that Obligation as normal. At the MC's discretion, a player may be able to buy more Resources with more Obligations. Some characters will have retreated entirely from the mortal world or have been out of circulation long enough as to make no difference. As such, it is entirely possible that the character has no access to Resources in "mortal life" at all. It's not weird for characters to begin an In Medias Res story living in a cardboard box in an alley with no job or registration in government documents.

#### Motivations

The character in an In Medias Res story presumably has a Master Passion. If it's not the same as the default one for their supernatural type, there should be a good in-character reason for that. While they are supernatural and non-human, they should presumably still have Driving Passions and Ethical Taboos. So the player should define some for their character. The player should really think about what their character wants, and what their character is willing to do to get what they want.

#### Advantages and Disadvantages

Characters can have Advantages and Disadvantages, but the number of the one should equal the number of the other.

#### Magical Transformation

Characters in an In Medias Res game have been supernatural for some time and have developed some tricks that are their own in addition to having a mastery of their form and the basic powers that come with it. The character has the 6 Basic and 2 Advanced Powers common to their type, and have developed 2 Basic Power and an Advanced Power that are theirs. In addition, the character knows one Basic or Advanced Power that must be from a Universal Power or the Sorcery that their Cult (if any) specializes in. None of this applies to mortal hunters.

#### Place in the Worlds

The character is _involved_ with Supernatural Society. They already are a citizen of one Syndicate or another (this need not be the dominant Syndicate in the city the story begins in, the character could easily have spent formative years elsewhere or under the tutelage of another who was). If the player wishes their character to be a member of one Cult or another, they can simply declare that on character generation.

Mortal hunters are not likely to be members of a Syndicate, but they may be members of a Cult or antagonistic organization and are likely familiar with some information about monstrous society.

### The Power Fantasy
_I will crush you_

Characters in a Power Fantasy game have the strength to throw their weight around and challenge other powerful creatures in personal conflicts. There are unfortunately no firm guidelines that can be given to what marks a good Power Fantasy Character. A chronicle where the characters are expected to ultimately square off against some wicked Ifrit may well have characters come in with a Potency of 2, while a chronicle where the characters were ultimately going to be up against The King with Three Shadows would expect characters with a Potency of 6 or even 7. Nonetheless, guidelines are provided for the former, to contrast with In Media Res characters and give some indication of what powerful monstrous NPCs might look like.

The important consideration is that characters in a Power Fantasy game should have roughly _equal_ bonuses. Although it is important to note that characters in such a game will be expected to be more divergent in capabilities. The nature of the dicepool system means that specialists in any field will roll more extra dice in their specialty than the other characters do than in an Origin Story or In Medias Res game. It can lend the air of a game of rocket launcher tag in Doom or Unreal. Which for a game where things are supposed to feel powerful is fine.

Monster Hunters are extremely unlikely to make it to Power Fantasy levels without having a Magical Transformation of their own, but a one-in-a-billion hunter could exist with similar guidelines if so desired.

#### Attributes

All of a character's attributes start at 4. The player then prioritizes their Physical, Mental, and Social attributes, distributing 3 points to one pair, 5 points to another pair and 6 points to the last pair. Luminaries begin the game with an Edge of 3. Then they get 5 additional points that they can place anywhere they want, including edge. The character has a Potency of 3 and therefore a Power Reserve of 15. Attributes for Power Fantasy characters are limited to 8 (a base of 6 + Potency 2). 

#### Active Skills

A character's Active Skills start at zero. The player then prioritizes their Physical, Social, and Technical skills, distributing 15 points to one set, 20 points to the second set, and 24 points to the last set. Then they get 10 points they can place anywhere they want. An individual skill can be as high as Edge allows. The character then chooses five skill specializations. Remember that they also gain a specialization for each Technical skill they have trained.

#### Backgrounds

A character starts with 40 points of Backgrounds. No Background can start higher than rating 8. Power Fantasy characters may have little to do with the mortal world or approach it from a position of extreme power and should have some leeway to define their baskgrounds to express their inhuman lives and abilities if they wish.

#### Resources

The player chooses one 4-point resource, two 3-point Resources, two 2-point Resources, and one 1-point Resources. The player must take an Obligation of rating 4 or less, but they get to buy an extra Resource for taking that Obligation as normal. At the MC's discretion, a player may be able to buy more Resources with more Obligations. Power Fantasy characters should have considerable freedom to define their Resources and Obligations.

#### Motivations

The character in an In Medias Res story presumably has a Master Passion. If it's not the same as the default one for their supernatural type, there should be a good in-character reason for that. While they are supernatural and non-human, they should presumably still have Driving Passions and Ethical Taboos. So the player should define some for their character. The player should really think about what their character wants, and what their character is willing to do to get what they want.

#### Advantages and Disadvantages

Power Fantasy characters should have a Disadvantage to match their additional Potency. They may have additional Disadvantages to match any other Advantages they may have.

#### Magical Transformation

Characters in an Power Fantasy game have not only been monsters for as much as a human lifetime but have likely been pursuing additional supernatural power and mastery on a personal path for all that time. The character has the 6 Basic and 2 Advanced Powers common to their type, and have developed 5 Basic Power and 3 Advanced Powers that are theirs, which may be from any Power Group related to their monstrous type, Cult Sorcery or any one or two other Sorcery Paths.

#### Place in the Worlds

The character is likely to be not just involved with Supernatural Society, but actively taking part in running it. They usually have Status in their Syndicate and may have formally recognized status with others (particularly whatever Syndicate is dominant in the primary setting of the game). The character may also have substantial status within one (or more) Cults.
