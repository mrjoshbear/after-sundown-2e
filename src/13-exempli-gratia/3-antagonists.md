### Example Antagonists

#### Bystander

The average modern person is not equipped to deal with horror, monsters, magic, or anything else supernatural. Their dicepools suck for almost everything they would be expected to do in an action scene. Nonetheless, almost everyone is good at _something_. Whatever that is, bump up the relevant attribute(s) by a point or two and give them a couple skill points and maybe a specialty related to it, bringing them to a dicepool around 8-10 in one or two things.

#### Security Guard

The average rent-a-cop or nightwatchman receives little training and barely more than minimum wage. They are mostly there to deter problems by their mere presence and unlikely to be called upon to do much more than pick up the phone to make a report when something goes wrong. Most don't carry weapons and are in fact forbidden from doing so while on the job, but they probably know where the first aid kits are kept at least. Poor pay means they are often susceptible to bribes, and they tend to have pretty good practical knowledge of the particular security systems and procedures at the places they work, so paying them off is pretty useful. More competent security officers have qualifications (and equipment) similar to patrol officers or detectives because many of them are in fact patrol officers or detectives doing private security work as a second job. Others may have former military or police experience.

#### Patrol Officer

The basic police unit that walks or drives a beat is distinguished primarily by the fact that they are trained and tested on doing all the the things they are ostensibly supposed to know how to do, although that training tends to be a lot less than people expect or would hope for. Uniformed police tend to carry a _lot_ of gear around, not only on their person but especially loaded into patrol cars. Our example organization, the Chicago Police Department, has patrol officers armed with a 9 mm pistol and stun gun, with tactical 12-gauge shotguns or AR-15 rifles racked in the trunks of patrol cars, and wearing mandatory NIJ-II soft-armor vests for field duties, besides having a ton of less violent gear on their belt or in their car. A significant number are on the take or at least have exploitable personal problems that can be used to get them there.

#### Detective

Normally plain clothes, armor and additional weapons often available in vehicle. 

Due to specialization their dicepools for evidence gathering (12) and catching lies (11) are high enough to be effective against starting players characters on occasion.

#### Tactical Officer

Most policing agencies have the ability to call on special tactical units whether they call them SWAT Teams, SFOs, gendarmes, or something else entirely. The important thing is that while these guys die in horror movies all the time the fact that they get to walk around with heavy armor and assault rifles makes them a very dangerous threat to most people and even a fair number of monsters.

In most places these officers arenâ€™t just training and waiting to be called but are serving as patrol officers or investigators that undergo weekly or monthly training for tactical operations. In these circumstances it may take a minimum of a couple of hours just to assemble the team and their equipment. When they do get together, they frequently come in armored or military vehicles and may be supported by sharpshooters and grenade launchers loaded with tear gas.

#### Infantry

This is about as good as it gets for mortal extras. They aren't necessarily better than police tactical officers in most situations, but they do a lot of training, they're very well equipped and generally lead by competent tactical officers. Moreover, they aren't limited to flash-bangs and tear gas; infantry have f

#### Average Shambler

An Extra transformed into a Shambler isn't much of a threat on their own. Even with increased Strength, their lack of skills keep their dicepools low in combat. Shambler's might try to beat someone down with fists if ordered, but classically they try to grab and then bite targets, which the human jaw isn't particularly great at.

#### Average Soulless

The given stats assume that the Soulless is currently subject to Frenzy and haven't lost the benefit of Vigor due to sunlight.

Brawl: Dicepool 7; Damage 0N  
Defense: 3; Soak 7  

#### Killer Automaton (Animate Spawn)

The standard non-Luminary killer robot benefits from being built of metal and having Strength beyond what a human is capable of, but isn't much better than a Shambler tactically. On the other hand they can both soak up and deal a lot of damage, and Nimble Feet means they are terribly difficult to run away from. Several example weapons are listed but most Automata will only have one or two and they will generally employ the Spray-n-Pray option with their ranged weapons.

Automata are effectively subject to Emptiness. The listed Strength includes the passive Vigor that is lost if they are weakened by alcohol.

#### Vampire's Thrall (Spawn)

Most Thralls are Attractive; it usually factors into why they were selected in the first place and represents a significant survival trait.
