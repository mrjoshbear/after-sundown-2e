## Animates: Unloved Creations

_"Once upon a time, there was... 'A king!' my little readers will say right away. No, children, you are wrong. Once upon a time there was a piece of wood..."_

Animates are different from the other types of supernaturals because they are not born as a human only to later achieve supernatural powers, but are instead created fully formed and fully grown with their powers already intrinsic to them. An Animate awakens for the first time already an outcast, already both more and less than a human. Animates are almost always rejected by humanity because regardless of how much they try, they are _not_ humans. Every Animate is not only the first of its kind, it is also the _last_ of its kind. Every Animate creation event is unique and Animates tragically find that even other created life is intrinsically _distinct_ from them, different from humanity in ways which likewise reveal a difference that is just as unbridgeable.

Animates are capable of being Extras and Luminaries just as normal humans are. In general, a mad scientist's masterwork is a Luminary Animate (the kind that might be a player character), and a batch of killer robots is probably a bunch of Animate Spawn. This means that yes, those Animates who have peers don't even care because those are just background characters and mooks in their own story.

All Animates use a Ritual Power Schedule. As creatures of false life they suffer aggravated damage from wooden weapons as if they were undead. In most cases, Animates are dominated by Master Passion: Loneliness, a condition not unrelated to the fact that each Animate is literally without peers. They have more difficulty making emotional connections then virtually any other creature, and pine for the loss.

> Sometimes a relatively well-balanced mortal Luminary might _try_, but they have never succeeded in creating a Luminary Animate. Some think that animation of unliving matter is truly a form of *Mad* Science, and the sane are simply incapable of grasping it: you have to have a Master Passion to create new pseudo-life, and that very madness will inevitably result in an emotionally flawed person who is in turn subject to a Master Passion. A few of the more annoyingly esoteric occultists instead suggest that it works just fine and isn't even that uncommon; it's just that if a fairly normal and reasonably sane person managed to create a new person the result would just be another fairly normal, reasonably sane person, no different than the children born every day that were "created" by in vitro fertilization.

#### Created Bodies

Many Animates are created out of human flesh. Sometimes it is as simple as cobbling together body parts and then harnessing lightning or mystic power to bring it to life. Sometimes they are grown in tanks like Hank and Dean. And in yet other methods of creation they are crafted in some other medium such as wood or stone and then _transformed_ into human flesh. Regardless of the creation methodology, an Animate crafted of flesh is close enough to human in appearance to pass for one, albeit perhaps a very sick one. Other Animates can be made of circuitry, gears, or simply polished marble that never had anything like an organic life. Usually, these are crafted such that they approximate human appearance and can pass as human, while others are clearly artificial and mechanical in appearance and rely on Guise in order to go unnoticed. Mechanically, the real difference is that fleshy Animates have Restoration and solid or mechanical ones have Grotesque Aegis. 

> #### Implanted Memories
>
> While the conventional Animate was created a blank-slate, others may have false memories implanted, either deliberately as a way to boot-strap their social abilities or accidentally as a part of the process of assembling the creation. While these memories will tend to ring false, they do provide a way to connect an Animate's story with that of a mortal character. This provides a way to have a kind of continuity for an Origin Story character whose player would like to play an Animate, which does not really have a magical transformation the way other playable types do. 

### Frankensteins: Lost Children

_"My heart was fashioned to be susceptible of love and sympathy, and when wrenched by misery to vice and hatred, it did not endure the violence of the change without torture such as you cannot even imagine."_

Frankensteins are crafted to be new living things. They are essentially people, albeit designed rather than evolved. Unfortunately, the creators of these new creatures almost never take to their assumed role as a parent, because the Frankenstein is never truly a baby and never truly a human. Propelled into existence with a grown human's size and facilities, they nonetheless suffer from having missed the opportunities to be juvenile. Like a child forced to be a soldier or bride, a Frankenstein's life will always have deeply painful emotional issues. They will always be childlike in some aspects of their existence, even if they live to be hundreds of years old.

A Frankenstein has an Orphic power source and a Ritual power schedule. As Animates they are vulnerable to wood and weakened by alcohol.

> Frankenstein is the name of the creator, and not the name of the creature. Nonetheless, the creature himself has come to be known as Frankenstein and that's good enough for our needs.

### Robots: Neglected Servants

_"Did I request thee, Maker from my clay  
To mould Me man? Did I solicit thee  
From darkness to promote me?"_

Created strong of body and unending in endurance, the Robot is made to do tasks that humans don't want to and to not bother anyone while doing them. Often these jobs are demeaning or dangerous, and it is no surprise that Robots rarely want to do the things that are asked of them. They are beneath the notice of their creators, like a tool that is not in use or a person of low social status. Robots often appear crude and even inhuman, having been created for physical functionality rather than social niceties. They are the type of Animate most likely to have artificial utilitarian bodies, but sorcerers have also been creating homunculus servants for millennia.

Luminary Robots have all the subjectivity and potential emotional complexity of any human, but the way they have been objectified has left them underdeveloped. Whenever they do draw the attention of others their distinctly non-human, or non-_living_, appearance makes them difficult to accept and relate to.

A Robot has an Astral power source and a Ritual power schedule. As Animates they are vulnerable to wood and weakened by alcohol.

### Galateans: Forsaken Lovers

_"How fully functional are you?"_

Galateans are created from a selfish desire for a perfect lover. Whether man, woman, both, or neither, a Galatean is - or once was - beautiful beyond what normal humans are capable of. Unfortunately, the artificial perfection of their exterior belies a flawed emotional interior that makes interpersonal relationships miserable and difficult. The feelings of a Galtatean, though strongly felt, are simply too extreme and without nuance for others to relate to. To a normal, human individual the love of a Galtatean is as off-putting as their hatred. Galateans do not look anything other than human on initial inspection; however, there is something distinctly "not right" about them which will creep out any normal human who interacts with them socially for long.

A Galtatean has an Infernal power source and a Ritual power schedule. As Animates they are vulnerable to wood and weakened by alcohol.
