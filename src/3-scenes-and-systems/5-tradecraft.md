## Tradecraft

_"Over the course of two months he's called home from six different pay phones, from two different cities, never using the same phone twice. And when his mother asked him where he was, he lied. He said that he was in a place in the country with bad cell reception—implying he was in the Tribals—but he was in Peshawar. I'm sorry, but that's not normal guy behavior. That's tradecraft." —Agent Maya, Zero Dark Thirty (2012)_

The vast majority of actual intelligence work is, like all investigation, actually just sorting through information and talking to people. For that the [Montages](2-montages.md) and [Interviews](3-interviews.md) sections have you covered; tradecraft is the sexy part of spying that takes place in the field.

Above tiny Bands that usually meet in person and have deeply personal bonds of loyalty the institutions of monstrous society - the Cults and Syndicates - are explicitly secret conspiracies that are trying to hide their very existence from the rest of the world. Essentially this means that living with them - or working against them - is in part much the same sorts of activity that the espionage community engages in, and thus many of the same techniques and skills - collectively referred to as _tradecraft_ - are required. In a sense, the Vow of Silence is about maintaining good _operational security_ regarding everything supernatural; it's just that we don't recognize some of that security as such because monsters have the option of using literal magic instead of mortal means. But if you're the one fighting the monsters it's all the more important that you keep everything as secret and secure as you can, because those conspiracies will try every trick in the book to stop you.

### Secret Communication

_"How long do you want these messages to remain secret?"  
"I want them to remain secret for as long as men are capable of evil."  
― Neal Stephenson, Cryptonomicon_

Practically every way that you might want to talk to someone at a distance is heavily monitored by dozens of intelligence agencies. Finding things out is largely a matter of having access; unencrypted communications are available to people with the right Intelligence Resources; sorting through the vast amount of information available - if you don't already have a name or number to check - would be a test of Logic + Research or Logic + Electronics. Using encryption for every communication is the most basic opsec.

You should be using encryption. The one problem with using encryption to keep your secrets is that computers are too good at it; you can't keep up with the kind of cryptanalysis a computer can do without using a computer yourself, and then you've saddled yourself with whatever security flaws that computer has (and they always have some). While there is comparatively little risk to ordering packages online, anything that needs to be absolutely secret - like the fact that can beat a ghost to extra-death with a baseball bat or that you stole state secrets - can't fully trust most encryption to be totally secure. Any attempt to keep a message secure comes down to a resisted roll of Logic + Electronics (with a Specialization like "Security" or "Hacking") if anyone has access to a system along the chain of computers involved.

One-time-pads are the exception: you sit down and flip a coin or whatever until you've filled up a page with as many bits as your expected message. You send a copy with whoever you want to talk to later, and when a message needs to be sent you use the sheet as your cipher, then burn it. So long as you never lose it or reuse it there is absolutely nothing that can be done with cryptanalysis to break the code. The logistics of using a one-time-pad are almost completely hopeless; however, as you need to produce a lot of pad for any substantial amount of message, know you need it in advance, and then keep both copies secure both before and after they are used. Employing the pad without error would be a test of Logic + Operations with a threshold of 1.

Book ciphers are another option. Messages are hidden as references to particular line or word in a commonly published book that both Alice and Bob have access to, classically the Bible, which has so many editions and translations that the third word of the 15th line on the 100th page could be practically anything. So long as the individual references are varied enough and the messages are short enough it's hard for frequency analysis to figure out the message. Groups like the Daziban can use incredibly obscure works in their book ciphers.

Class pre-software ciphers stop casual eavesdropping, but anyone with the basic digital tools can break them with a Logic + Electronics test against a threshold of 1; they just can't stand up to digital cryptanalysis with a modern computer.

#### Coded Language

Instead of ciphers, most low-tech operations use coded language: they employ normal speech except for a few key words or phrases that have a secret meaning, hiding the significance and meaning of their conversation in plain sight. Code names are a prime example; just call your target "the hawk" and no one will know exactly who you're hunting. Codes like this are still vulnerable to analysis, but so long as you keep them simple enough to do in your head you don't have to worry about computer security holes leaking your secrets.

Characters could also just share an entire language that is a secret to everyone else. The oldest Makhzen courts have the advantage that no one else speaks their languages anymore. No one will figure out what you're saying in Linear A unless they have some way to crack a translation into another language. The language doesn't even have to be secret; Navajo worked pretty well in World War II. In general, having a shared secret language requires the characters to all have at least one point in a Language background.
