# Scenes & Systems

There are many types of stories that can be told through After Sundown, including perhaps somethings that would be barely recognized as coherent stories at all. And while there is a broad limit to the sorts that these rules can allow, even within that there are various choices of focus that need to be made. 

## Flow Control & Storytelling Techniques

While the game may proceed at any timescale, from tracking every combat round to passing years with little notice, most of the time action is divided into _Scenes_, which are more abstract. Roughly speaking, a scene is a narrative measure of time that takes place in a single location and concerns one principle activity. There's no strict limit, but generally scenes should be a few hours at most and certainly less than a full day.

Player characters will often primarily be interested in when scenes are cut because some of their powers will end or need to be refreshed when they start a new scene. But from the MC's perspective, the most important thing is when to cut away from one level of detail to another. It's not necessary to have everything occur in a scene; it's acceptable to just provide some narration to bridge into the next interesting thing.

Similarly, _Chapters_ are a larger unit of narrative time, covering a single Mission or other major action that has it's own rise and fall. Chapters generally take several gaming sessions over a dozen hours to resolve, and are important because they represent when characters get Karmic Advancement. Each Chapter should have its own larger scope of rising and resolving action, although as with scenes there's no requirement that the player characters be successful by the end of the chapter.

### Setting the Scene

New scenes often start by framing the location  - an _establishing shot_ - followed by the most critical details about _who_ and _what_ (_mise en sc√©ne_) is present in that location. The goal here is to present the maximum amount of thematic and useful (to the players) content with a minimum of words and time. Two or three tight sentences is about what you get, which is not much. Try to start with open-ended hooks that give broad strokes and let the players direct attention themselves to dig further into the details you've teased. For instance, you can mention a bar, but save the description of the furniture, drinks, and staff until the players ask about or move towards the bar specifically. Similarly, by using recurring locations you have the ability to build up and riff on those details over time.

A good way to economize on lists and descriptions is with recurring _motifs_ that represent both the thematic content of the game and something interactive for the players to do things with. Don't just have a group of characters that appear unrelated, but give them a consistent look and behavior. Use similar imagery and recurring classes of objects, like particular types of food, drinks, furniture, and decoration. Think of the set dressing in the _Matrix_, which combines deteriorating buildings, antique furniture, and strange technological apparatus. This gives us a combination of technothriller and noir moods, while the particulars of the buildings and technology are important to the characters' strategies (like escaping through a wet wall that is open between floors). When players have a background of awareness of the sorts of impromptu resources their characters have available to them it helps them to creatively intertwine their character's actions into the world.

### Fade to Black

_"You never see anything anyway. They always, uh, turn the camera, and... play music and... y'know, the wind blows and then the curtain moves. You don't see anything."_

When the action of the scene goes into territory that your group doesn't want to examine in detail - for any reason - you can manage the implicit inclusion of that action by setting up the implication of what the action will be and cutting away before the action occurs, which is usually called a "fade to black" from the literal technique of reducing the brightness to produce a fully dark screen.

While this can be used to avoid disturbing content, it's important to note that it can also draw attention to it. A great example of this is in the 1931 Frankenstein, in which the monster was originally shown to throw a little girl into a river in a misunderstanding of the game they were playing. When censors cut the scene just a bit earlier it resulted in the following discovery of her death implying a much darker possible version of the scene in the audience's imagination. Similarly, the MC can sometimes create terror and horror most easily by having the action occur just out of the character's ability to perceive it, or by having them encounter the results of the actions without witnessing them.
