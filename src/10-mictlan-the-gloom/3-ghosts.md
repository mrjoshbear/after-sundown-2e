## Ghosts
_"What we have here is what we call a non-repeating phantasm."_

The most numerous of supernatural creatures is the Ghost. One of them could be created every time someone dies, there are over seven billion people, and the number of deaths is (at least) one per person.

Every Ghost has tremendous difficulty interacting with the material world. They are native to the Gloom, and when they _do_ manage to leave the Mictlan their Empty Body turns on and they are unable to touch any physical object that is not made of wood. Because of their extreme difficulty in interacting with things, Ghosts often make rather limited actors in a story, and are thus ill suited to be main characters.

All Ghosts have an Orphic power source. Their unlives are sad and lonely ones for the most part, and they tend toward Master Passions of Loneliness or Despair.

### Wisps
_"Oooh..."_

Wisps are little shadows or colored glows that flit about and scarcely remember that they used to be humans. Individual Wisps are everywhere, and usually fairly inconsequential. Some Wisps make their way to the material world and scare people or try to interact with the world as they remember it being - it's a pretty frustrating experience because they can't actually touch most things.

Wisps primarily interact with an After Sundown chronicle by being utilized by necromancers as spies. Even without being compelled into service Wisps are often quite willing to be helpful to physical beings that can interact with them. Wisps have a Strength score of 1, regardless of what they had in life.

A Wisp has an Orphic power source and a Lunar power schedule. As undead they are vulnerable to wood and weakened by sunlight.

### Wraiths
_"You know, the best way to get rid of ghosts is to clean house."_

Wraiths appear as they did in life save with photographic filters applied to make them look washed out and see-through. Each Wraith is a specific person that died, and they tend to have goals that tie into their time while alive or the circumstances of their death. A Wraith that accomplishes its driving goal often dissolves into a happy ending. But sometimes a Luminary Wraith will simply go on and make an unlife for themselves in supernatural society.

Like all Ghosts, a Wraith is only corporeal while within the Gloom, and can only be in the mortal world until the sun rises before being banished back to Mictlan. Each Wraith has a number of things that tie them to the real world called "fetters". These can be favored objects, their own corpse, or loved ones. In order to regain Magic Points they have to be within a few meters of one of their fetters and interact with it in some obsessive way. If a Wraith loses track of their fetters, they cannot regain Magic Points and are doomed to slowly fade away. If a Wraith attains its primary goal and persists afterwards, they can stop obsessing over the past and make a new life with new fetters.

Some Luminary Wraiths come into being with a lot of extra disciplines, putting them on close to the same footing as a normal player character. Some people might even be tempted to run Wraith chronicles, but that's really very difficult role playing.

A Wraith has an Orphic power source and a Ritual power schedule. As undead they are vulnerable to wood and weakened by sunlight.

### Poltergeists
_"They're here..."_

Poltergeists are accumulations of untold numbers of wisps that have lost their individuality and become spiritual storms. Ruled by rage and quite destructive, Poltergeists can't even speak save to wail and scream. Sometimes they are tied to a location, sometimes they travel around Mictlan like thunderheads. In either case, they usually have some relation to a specific atrocity or another, and will calm down and disperse if someone can figure out how to appease them despite their inarticulate destruction.

Like all Ghosts, a Poltergeist has an Empty Body unless they are in Mictlan. They also have a Charisma and Logic of zero. They have no specific limits for other attributes, and larger storms have more Strength and more Willpower...

A Poltergeist has an Orphic power source and a Lunar power schedule. Unlike most ghosts they almost always have Master Passion Rage. As undead they are vulnerable to wood and weakened by sunlight.

#### Dybbuk
_"TK"_

When Wraiths grow old in their unlife and watch everything they care about wither away, sometimes they get worse. Their minds are warped by one frenzy after another as their other fetters fall into history until hatred of the living is all they have left, and then in a vicious cycle that becomes the one thing that sustains them. It's a sad fate, but there's a lot of bad going around in the world of horror and not much reason to care.

The problem is that a rare few these broken souls eventually reach something like Elderhood and develop powers that let them bother the living. A Dybbuk is driven to find ways out of Mictlan to torment mortals, feeding off of their pain and destruction until they can gather the power to possess one and go joyriding in their new body.

A Dybbuk has an Orphic power source and a Feeding power schedule. They are usually dominated by Master Passion Rage. As undead they are vulnerable to wood and weakened by sunlight.
