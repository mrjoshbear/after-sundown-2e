## A Lexicon of Monstrous Society

N.B. Unlike the Glossary, which lists game terms as used by _players_, this Lexicon is intended for use in-character by the subjects of the game.

Baby
: _slang_ a newly transformed monster. Usually compounded with mildly offensive epithets, e.g. "baby-bat" for newly risen Camazotz.

Band
: a small group of Monsters that share personal bonds of loyalty; a sort of chosen family of the supernatural.

Bloodbag
: _slang_ a mortal with an interest - usually sexual - in being fed on by Vampires or other blood-drinking monsters. By extension, any mortal that is easy for monsters to feed on.

Bumin Hoarde, The
: a former Syndicate destroyed and absorbed by the Cauchemar Communes. Remains only as TK cult.

Cauchemar
: _Communes_ from the French for nightmare; the Monsters of the Cauchemar Communes, or by extension the members of any Syndicate or the type that could be. See _Kin_

Cauchemar Communes
: the youngest extant syndicate. Organized as a permanent revolution. Their expansion has generally followed the socialist diaspora out of Europe, giving them power in Northern Europe, the American Midwest, and much of inland Russia and China.

Communes, The
: see _Cauchemar Communes_.

Covenant, The
: a syndicate dating back to the early medieval era. Organized as a parody of the hierarchy of the Catholic Church. Holds power in much the same territory as the church it reflects, including much of Southern Europe, Central America, and South America.

Crowley
: _slang_ a mortal with an exploitable interest in the occult.

Cult
: a supernatural organization that has some occult purpose. Generally bigger than a Band and smaller than a Syndicate.

Damned, the
: _Covenant_ the sort of monsters accepted into the Covenant; by extension, the members of any Syndicate. See _Kin_

Elder
: a Monster that has developed greater Potency and unique powers, either by surviving as a Monster for longer than a human lifetime or stealing it (see Titaning).

False Face, The
: a former Syndicate now reduced to the status of a cult. Previously extended throughout the Americas. Notable due to the fact that wars between the False Face and the Covenant lead to the modern peace between the Syndicates.

Fam
: _slang_ the sort of monsters that are generally accepted by the Syndicates. Adopted from the LGBTQ community. See _Kin_.
: _slang_ a Monster's closest associates. See _Band_.

Going Loud
: _slang_ using magic that would break the Vow of Silence if mortals witnessed it. Most commonly used to refer to situations where this isn't a problem, such as in the Otherworlds.

Harker
: _slang_ a mortal employed by a monster as a cut-out or intermediary to interact with mortal society on their behalf. Specialists exist for setting people up with arms-length Harkers hidden within webs of shell corporations.

Kin, Kinfolk
: _Makzen_ the common English translation of the Persian "دوستان ما"; members of the Makhzen.
: _Makzen_ the sort of Monsters considered for membership in the Makhzen and other Syndicates: Animates, Leviathan, Lycanthropes, Transhumans, Vampires, Witches, and sometimes the Outliers.

Lab
: _slang_ a private place where monsters can meet, feed, or perform rituals without being disturbed by mortals.

League, The
: see _World Crime League_

Helsing
: _slang_ a monster hunter with enough real knowledge of the supernatural to be dangerous, either physically or (more importantly) because they might create publicity and endanger the Vow of Silence. Syndicates usually eliminate Helsings, but sometimes they are recruited or employed against their enemies.

Makzen, The
: the oldest of the extant Syndicates, supposedly dating to the 800s BCE in Persia. Organized as an alliance of independent city-states. Still powerful along much of the Silk Road, Africa, and the American South.

Monster Fucker
: _slang_ a mortal that has a sexual fetish for monsters; a candidate Renfield. Adopted from Internet usage. See _Bloodbag_.

Our Friends
: _WCL_ English translation from the Vietnamese "bạn bè của chúng ta"; members of the World Crime League. By extension, members of any Syndicate or the sort accepted for membership. See _Kin_

Quickening
: _slang_ a more modern term for _Titaning_. Taken from the "Highlander" franchise.

Renfield
: _slang_ a mortal slave of a Monster. Syndicate justice generally considers a Monster to be responsible for the actions of their Renfields, which in turn means that most of them are kept on a very short leash by magical means.

Syndicate
: one of the global conspiracies of Monsters that make up the backbone of supernatural society. The four Syndicates that exist in the modern era are the Makhzen, the Covenant, the World Crime League, and the Cauchemar Communes. The otherworldly Marduk Society, Shattered Empire, and King with Three Shadows are sometimes lumped in but are not considered Syndicates proper.

Titaning
: gaining personal power by killing Monsters and (usually) eating them, especially when applied to Elders. See _Quickening_.

Vow of Silence
: the most important rule upheld by all of the Syndicates: you do not tell mortals about the supernatural. Violations of the Vow of Silence potentially carry the death penalty in most every part of monstrous society.

World Crime League, The
: a Syndicate that split off from the Makhzen after the Mongol invasions into Southern Asia. Organized as a pirate council. Holds territory around most of the Pacific Rim and Indian Ocean.
