## The Limits of Magic
_"She made me into a newt!"_

Magic in a told story does not need to have _explicit_ limits defined for it because it has _implicit_ limits of whatever it is that magic happens to do in the story. One can assume that many of the things that magic never did in the narrative were actually outside of its capabilities for one reason or another and that it all worked out somehow. A novel or a movie does not have to tell you that an evil magic car _can't_ turn into a giant robot, the fact that it _doesn't_ is sufficient for the purposes of the medium. However in a _role playing game_ this is absolutely not the case. Since magic is going to be used in creative, goal oriented ways by multiple story contributors (which is a nice way of saying "people are going to push magic as far as it will go into unintended directions in an effort to gain personal advantage"), it is imperative that what magic is specifically capable (and by extension _not_ capable) of doing be codified.

Magic in After Sundown comes in several flavors. Most importantly, magic falls into one of three categories based on where its power comes from. All magic is connected to the Otherworlds, and the particular world flavors everything about it. These are Astral, Infernal, and Orphic. Supernatural creatures are also inherently tied to these same power sources. Some basic abilities are "Universal", but they still have a power source based on that of the character using them.

Every supernatural type has some inherent magic associated with it. Even though a Transhuman may have been granted all of their power from a mystic ritual that looks suspiciously like Sorcery, once they have attained that status they are able to use many of their abilities without having to remember mystical formulas or speak arcane words. The Invisible Man can fade from view without "doing" anything, and it is this point which makes his signature Invisibility power an inherent rather than sorcerous one. These magical abilities come in distinct groups called Universal Powers. On the other hand, Dr. West is a Khaibit and his signature power to raise the dead requires mystical effort on his part, and that makes it a sorcerous rather than inherent power.


## Detecting Magic
_"No way. No way nohow."_

Sorcery and witchcraft doesn't "just happen" it requires a great deal of evil knowledge and a fair amount of effort. And indeed that exertion can be detected and the efforts unraveled. Those in the know can detect and track the use of spells and sorcery by their effects on certain elements of the world.

Magic has definite effects on the physical world, and can be detected through careful observation of its effects. The particulars of detection are specific to whether it is Astral, Infernal, or Orphic. And when creatures who are personally one of those types use Universal Powers they can be detected as if they were using magic of that type. So if a Frankenstein (an Orphic creature) uses Devastation to lift a car it is an Orphic Magical Action and can be detected by the browning of nearby leaves; while an Android (an Infernal creature) doing the same thing would be an Infernal Magical Action that could be detected by the clouding of clear water.

When a creature activates a power, characters with the right equipment and knowhow can spot the power surge with a Dowsing Test. A Dowsing Test can always be Intuition + Perception, but dowsing for Astral Magic can also be Logic + Operations, dowsing for Infernal Magic can also be Logic + Survival, and dowsing for Orphic Magic can also be Charisma + Animal Ken. In general, the threshold to notice magic at normal range is 2, and the threshold to give a good directionality to where the magic was used is 4. Mostly, Basic Powers are detectable to Way Out Range, Advanced Powers or the expenditure of 3 or more power points are detectable to Extreme Range, and Elder Powers or the expenditure of 5 power points are detectable out to Remote Range. The expenditure of more than 5 power points at once is detectable out to as many kilometers.

 * **Clean Water:** Clean water is pure and healthy and brings joy and solace. It is very much inimical to the magic of the Dark Reflection, which causes clear water to be come darkened momentarily as if it was tainted with soot. An experienced douser can track the strength and direction of the use of Infernal sorcery by the darkness, apparent direction, and persistence of the image of taint in otherwise clear water.
 * **Flowers:** Orphic Sorcery is bad for you. Like polonium or something. But for big creatures it's really not something you'd notice without years of exposure, leaving the really observable effects to the very most fragile of lifeforms - those who would soon die in any case. And while one _could_ tote around a bag full of mayflies or the like, most people in the know who want to track necromancers choose to use potted plants. A flower that blooms and dies every day is of course ideal, as it has a high responsiveness and gives good directionality.
 * **Magnets:** Astral Sorcery has a noticeable, if weird, affect on magnetic fields. You can track Astral Sorcery and gauge its power with a lodestone. Natural magnetite reacts more strongly than an electro-magnet for whatever reason, so experienced geomancers seriously carry a black rock on a string when they want to find dream sorcerers.

## Countering Magic

In addition to being able to _detect_ magic by it's physical effects, you can sometimes also _counter_ magic with the right physical material.

Throwing a handful of whatever appropriate powder at a source of magic is a Simple Action, and involves making an Intuition + Rigging or Agility + Athletics test, reducing the effective hits of the original casting by the hits gained. Once used to counter magic, the powder is completely spoiled. You can't sweep it up and use it again. While this is technically sorcery itself, it can be taught to any Luminary or supernatural creature in moments - you literally just reach into the bag, throw a handful of the stuff at the magic with intent to nullify, and it generally works pretty well. A power that is dispelled completely is suppressed and cannot be reactivated for the rest of the scene. The particular substance required depends on the power source of the magic to be affected, and using the wrong powder doesn't do anything but make a mess.

 * **Salt:** Salt draws water into itself and preserves food. Things treated with salt remain clean and non-poisonous long after untreated objects blacken and stink with putrescence. Thrown at Astral magic it draws the wetness and poison of the sorcery into itself and dampens it. 
 * **Sand:** The fires of Limbo burn ceaselessly, but they _are_ still fires. Clean sand thrown upon them douses them - cutting off the source of wicked Infernal sorcery.
 * **Seeds:** Representing the promise of new life and the growth of great strength from humble origins, the seed is a key ritual component in practically every mortal magical tradition ever devised. And indeed, throwing it on Orphic magic results in the nullification of both.

## Disciplines

Magical powers are grouped into interrelated paths of development called Disciplines. Disciplines are fairly broad and often times represent many different paths to power that are grouped together game mechanically because that's playable. Nevertheless, to represent the different approaches that magic responds to, every power with a dicepool to activate presents two different dice pools that they can be activated with.

Disciplines are divided by power source. Universal Disciplines tend to be broader and more subtle powers that are common to many types of supernatural creatures, while Disciplines aspected to particular Otherworlds represent magical knowledge that develop around that world's particular themes. The distinction is not always obvious, but basically Astral, Infernal, and Orphic Disciplines can be learned, taught, and found in books, while a Universal powers tend to be things that "just happen".

### Power Levels

There are three levels of achievement within each Discipline: **Basic**, **Advanced**, and **Elder**. A character must have at least one Basic ability in a Discipline before they can learn an Advanced ability of that Discipline, and a character must have at least one Advanced ability in a Discipline before they can learn an Elder ability of that Discipline. Further, each tier carries a minimum Potency requirement (1 for Basic, 2 for Advanced, and 3 or more for Elder). Abilities within a Discipline are otherwise unordered. A character can learn any Basic ability and then learn another Basic ability or skip to learning an Advanced ability.  Characters built for In Media Res games begin play with only Basic and Advanced abilities.

Elder powers tend to be more individualized to the possessor. Some may be fairly simple ways of intensifying or transcending the limitations of existing Basic and Advanced abilities, while others may be short-cuts to performing tricks otherwise limited to Mighty Rituals of Vast Power. Suggested Elder abilities and guidelines for their creation are described separately in Chapter TK, along with descriptions of the Elder powers that are standard to non-player supernatural types. Power Fantasy characters begin with a single, signature Elder power that they should develop with the MC for their game.

### Power Tags

Magic in After Sundown comes in several flavors beyond the division into Universal, Astral, Infernal, and Orphic. In the interest of standardization and clarity, common variations are marked with tags in the power's description, which are defined here.

Sometimes particular types of monsters (or just individuals) have their own peculiar variations on a power, which are marked by giving the power an additional tag in parenthesis after it's name; for instance, a Troll has Giant Size (Mutation), meaning they cannot control their Giant Size as if it were a Protean power and are stuck with it always on. Tags added to particular types or individuals override tags listed on the base power when declared this way.

#### Blatant

Blatant powers are obvious to everyone viewing them; they do something clearly impossible and supernatural. Using Blatant powers in front of mortal witnesses is always a breech of the Vow of Silence unless decisively covered up.

#### Inherent

Inherent powers are natural outgrowths of supernatural ability; they are intuitively or instinctively understood by the user and generally don't require any particularly mystical behavior to accomplish. Their effects may be blatantly supernatural, but from the user's perspective they just happen; e.g. a Golem doesn't need to perform any ritual to throw a car with Vigor or Devastation, they just pick up the car and throw it.

#### Passive

With a Passive power, the character doesn't need to do anything to activate it, they just always have the benefit (and perhaps detriment) of having it. Many Passive powers add bonuses to mundane actions, while other modify or remove limitations to other powers. Passive powers do not have a cost or action associated with their description.

#### Protean

Some powers are Protean abilities: ones that change the character's form. A character who knows any Protean secrets can return to their real form with a Complex action and a power point even if they have been transformed by hostile magic. Furthermore, if a character has multiple Protean abilities, they may activate more than one simultaneously, and the entire transformation takes the action of the longest transformation. So if the character has two different abilities that both take a Complex Action, they may activate both as a single Complex Action.

#### Mutation

Mutation is an alternative way to have a Protean power. Instead of having the ability to shapeshift between forms, the character is stuck with the power "always on", and can't turn it off or shift back into their "normal" form; in effect, the power represents their normal form. While this can be inconvenient, it frees them from having to pay any power point cost to activate the ability. A character that has a Mutation doesn't get the normal generic Protean ability to shift back to their "real" form unless they have another normal Protean power. An entry for a monstrous type or particular character should note which powers are taken as Mutations instead of Protean powers.

#### Sorcery

As opposed to Inherent powers, Sorcery requires the user to do something distinctly magical to use the power. Thematically speaking, sorcery is magical knowledge. Thus, much of it is newly researched and much of it can be discovered from ancient texts.

Powers marked as Sorcery are able to be dispelled with the standard salt/sand/seeds routine. If this is a Universal power, then the source is considered to be that of the character using it.

#### Subtle

Subtle powers are not easily noticed and using them does not produce any obvious evidence or indication of their activation, although sometimes their consequences may still be noticeable or even considered to be breaks of the Vow of Silence. Subtle powers are still cause a glow around the user and target when they are viewed with Aura Perception.
