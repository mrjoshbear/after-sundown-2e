# Universal Disciplines
_"This is what we are, and this is what you are."_

There are many things that magic can do in horror, and one of the most salient things for After Sundown is that it allows supernatural creatures to do amazing things. Universal powers are those that owe no special allegiance to any world or cult. They usually require no magic words or special gestures. Most importantly they can be spontaneously developed. A character who has the requisite option at character creation or advancement can simply acquire a Universal Power without any access to special training or magical research books.

## Authority
_"Look me in the eyes and tell me that again."_

Authority is the power to impress one's Will directly upon another. Authority requires eye contact to function, although only cursorily. A character who is closing their eyes or wearing mirror shades cannot be controlled with Authority (unless the user has Will to Power). A character who is actively attempting to avoid seeing a potential dominator's eyes may be able to do so, depending upon the actions in question. Activating Authority is generally an opposed test with the target defending with Willpower. When a character is compelled to do something which is against their Ideology, Tabboos, or Passions (usually including following suicidal orders, since staying alive is at least instrumental to most other goals), they may spend an action dithering. They at this point lose an entire round of actions as they have their internal struggle, making an additional resistance check to attempt to shake off the effects. If they again fail to resist the effects, they carry out the order even if it is something they are deeply opposed to. 

Most uses of Authority require instructions to be given to the victim in a manner that they can comprehend. Usually this requires verbal orders to be given in a language they understand, but sign language, written directions, and even silent telepathic commands can suffice. Influences from a character with Basic Authority can be disrupted as if it were a Sorcery with a power source identical to the character using it. The demands of a character with Advanced Authority require killing the user or Purify the Mind to undo, and a character with Elder Authority has their powers persist even after they are dead.

### Basic Authority

#### Command

**Cost:** -

**Action:** Complex, Willpower + Intimidation or Logic + Persuasion vs. target Willpower

The character gives an instantaneous verbal command, which the victim will follow to the best of their ability. The action itself must be essentially instantaneous, using up no more than a single complex action, and it needs to be able to be expressed in about 10 seconds. If it is of an open ended nature such as "lie down," then the victim will spend one complex action doing it, and then they are free to do as they please and wonder why they did that.

#### Mesmerism

**Cost:** -

**Action:** Extended (1+ minute), Logic + Persuasion or Willpower + Intimidation, vs. target Willpower

The character can hypnotize a victim, allowing them to give extended commands that will be obeyed. The expected time to bring someone under Mesmerism so that instructions can begin is one minute, then commands must be stressed and repeated, with each major instruction taking approximately an additional minute to convey. During the period of hypnotism, the victim stands there like an obviously hypnotized drone, but behaves seemingly normally when they go off to carry out their instructions. Any sudden sensory stimulation (such as a nearby gunshot or someone shaking the victim) during the Mesmerism breaks the spell. 

#### Suggestion
_Subtle_

**Cost:** -

**Action:** Simple, Logic + Tactics or Willpower + Expression vs. target Willpower

The character can offer a suggestion that the victim will then immediately themselves suggest as if it were their own idea. Whether this idea is followed up upon or discarded as "a bad idea" depends entirely upon how they feel about the idea once they've said it to themselves. The immediate victim does not remember being fed the suggestion in the first place, but the scene may look odd to onlookers.

### Advanced Authority

#### Cloud Memory

**Cost:** -

**Action:** Complex, Logic + Artisan or Willpower + Expression vs. target Willpower

Cloud Memory allows the character to erase or alter the memories of a victim. A single use of Cloud Memory can alter about 5 minutes of memory, but net hits increase the time frame. A Luminary who is presented with proof that their memories are incorrect may spend a Fate point to remember. Extras just have to resolve those discrepancies somehow.

#### Conditioning

**Cost:** 1 Fate

**Action:** Extended (1 day per target Willpower), Logic + Tactics or Willpower + Intimidation vs. 3 + target Potency

Using extended mind controlling techniques, a victim's will is broken and they are transformed into a servant of the character's. Breaking someone's mind in this manner is an extended task that has an expected time frame of 1 day per point of the victim's Willpower. Raw supernatural power makes a big difference in establishing control, so the Potency of the target is added to the difficulty threshold. Once a victim has been thralled, they follow all orders their new master gives them as if they had been imparted with the force of a successful Mesmerism. At the time of conditioning, the character may choose to alter the Ideologies, Taboos, and general demeanor of their victim (this is often done to make the giving of orders that would be against the original nature easier to do). Using Conditioning requires an Edge, and it fails if the process is interrupted long enough that it is not continued between when the sun rises or sets and the next time it sets or rises.

#### Purify the Mind

**Cost:** 2 Power Points

**Action:** Extended (10 minutes), Logic + Empathy or Willpower + Tactics, threshold variable

The character can heal madness in others. The purification requires continuous hand-to-face contact and eye contact. The difficulty threshold depends on the extremitude of the mental problem. A mere life damaging phobia requires professional intervention (Threshold 2), while a life destroying insanity is crazy extreme (Threshold 4). Undoing mental damage and memory edits from magical sources, such as other Authority powers, always has a Threshold equal to the number of hits gained to create the effect in the first place. If the character cures the affliction they know what it was and what it was about, so they can say something explanatory and insightful if they want. If the character fails, they get nothing but some nightmarish imagery and vague clues.

#### Will to Power
_Passive_

The character can ignore the eye contact restriction on Authority, allowing them to use the discipline on plants and ghosts and people wearing mirror shades. The target must still be able to receive the character's commands somehow, whether by hearing or seeing thier instructions or through telepathic contact.

## Celerity
_There she goes again._

Celerity is the power to move with the astonishing speed of the supernatural. In general, a character whose Celerity more than doubles their speed in any dimension would constitute a breach of the Vow of Silence, although usually characters are able to hold themselves down to a speed that seems merely extraordinary rather than fully impossible if they so choose. While Celerity becomes quite expensive in terms of Power Points, it is designed such that powers do not usually require a roll or action to activate, as those things paradoxically slow down the experience of acting quickly. Characters are specifically allowed to activate as many Celerity powers with a Free Action as they please.

### Basic Celerity

#### At The Last Moment
_Inherent_

**Cost:** 1 Power Point

**Action:** Free, special

The character always seems to have just enough time to notice danger and get out of the way. For one Power Point, they may use the Dodging or Diving for Cover movement options as a Free Action for any incoming danger they are aware of.

#### Nimble Feet
_Inherent_

**Cost:** 1 Power Point per scene

**Action:** Free, automatic

The character is able to walk and run at stupendous speeds. For 1 Power Point the character's personal movement rate is quadrupled for a scene. If the character has Advanced Celerity, the speed increase is itself increased to six times. If the character has Elder Celerity the movement increase is eight times. In addition, the character ignores penalties for acting while moving over difficult surfaces (although they may be slowed down by them as normal).

#### Serendipity
_Passive, Subtle_

Supernatural movement isn't purely about being _faster_, it's also about acting at _exactly_ the right time. With this power, the character's perfect timing and coordination allows them to take advantage of tiny opportunities that would otherwise be missed. While active, the character reduces the difficulty of all Stunts in a Chase sequence by 1. Additionally, over extended periods the character can get around quite quickly, usually reducing travel time by a factor of 2, as they weave effortlessly through traffic and obstacles and have a sixth sense about when to pour on the speed. The Stunt bonus from Serendipity does not stack with that from clinging.

### Advanced Celerity

#### Flight

**Cost:** 1 Power Point per Scene

**Action:** Free, automatic

The character can _fly_. Like they were a superhero. For 2 Power Points, the character can fly for the duration of a scene so long as they maintain a speed of at least an Ordinary Walk. If the character wishes to be able to slow down to a Careful Walk or hover (not move at all) without falling out of the sky, they have to spend another Power Point. Taking off or landing in cramped areas may require an Agility + Athletics stunt. A flying character moves 3 to 5 times as fast as one walking or running along the ground (multiplied by Nimble Feet as normal), and flying is not particularly tiring unless they actually make a Draining Sprint. Flight can be dispelled as a sorcery with 3 hits. A character whose flight has been dispelled falls.

#### Shifting Sands

**Cost:** 1 Power Point

**Action:** Reflexive, automatic

The character can rewind time and change their actions accordingly. The sands of time are heavy and small, and the character can only rewind a split second of time. As such, crucial events whose effects are not immediately obvious to the character have already escaped their grasp long before any calamity is apparent. As a reflexive action, the character can spend a Power Point to shift their position slightly (less than a meter) if they are immediately aware of some kind of danger (such as the floor giving way or being hit with a bullet) or other disaster. The character can use this to dodge a bullet or to be hit by a bullet that was intended for someone else, but the timing is so fine that they must make this choice before the soak roll is made. If they redirect an attack to themselves, they are struck with no net hits, regardless of whether they would have been easier or harder to strike than the intended target. This can also be used socially to prevent major faux pas, though it is useless if the character merely gradually got on the nerves of someone else. If the character gets no hits at all on a social test, they may spend a Power Point to re roll all the dice. If they get even one hit, then whatever mistakes were made are too far in the past when they become apparent and this power cannot be used.

#### Speed of Thought

**Cost:** 1 Power Point per Scene

**Action:** Free, automatic

While active, the character may perceive and derive meaning from fast moving objects. They may follow a specific card in a shuffled deck, read a sign on a fast moving train, or gauge the trajectories of bullets in flight. They gain a +4 bonus to Dodge Tests, and negate any bonuses opponents would glean from multiple attacks during an Initiative Pass.

#### Stunt Shooting

**Cost:** 1 Power Point per Scene

**Action:** Free, automatic

The character's impossibly fast movements and perfect control allow them to make flashy ranged attacks like firing multiple arrows at once into different targets, spraying a machine gun and hitting only enemy targets while missing the hostages, or fling three knives at a target like a ninja. Effectively, all of the character's attacks with ranged weapons are made with all of the benefits of a automatic weapon with none of the normal downsides (within the limits of plausibility; a character can still only fire a musket once per attack, but if several are available they could easily all the muskets they can reach). Further, the character takes no penalties for making ranged attacks while moving, driving, climbing, etc.

## Clout
_"I have the power!"_

Clout is the power to draw upon the great strength of the supernatural in order to perform feats of literal strength and other blatant supernatural applications of raw force. Clout is an odd case as regards the Vow of Silence because while it is accompanied by no flaming runes or crawling shadows, demonstrations of incredible strength strain credibility and perhaps worse they _draw comments_ from observers.

### Basic Clout

#### Clinging
_Passive_

The character can hold themselves onto vertical surfaces and even ceilings for extended periods of time without special equipment or apparent effort. They can easily move up or down sheer surfaces at the rate of a steady walk, and scuttle across ceilings at the rate of a careful walk without danger or exertion. When such a character attempts to pull Wuxia or Spiderman inspired stunts involving running on walls or brachiating over a crowd they find this much easier, because they can support their weight merely by putting a hand against a wall. For practical purposes, this means that such stunts are much less extreme _for them_ than they appear to outsiders. The thresholds are generally reduced by 2 (a crazy extreme stunt would be merely a professional stunt from their perspective).

#### Vigor
_Inherent_

**Cost:** 1 Power Point per Strength dot

**Action:** Free, automatic

The character may spend a Power Points to directly increase their Strength on a one-for-one basis for the remainder of the scene. This may be activated more than once, and its effects stack. While using Vigor itself has no visible effects, the _use_ of vastly increased strength may be obviously unnatural to onlookers. The maximum number of Power Points a character can spend in a scene on Vigor is three plus their Potency.

### Advanced Clout

#### Burrowing
_Inherent_

**Cost:** 1 Power Point

**Action:** Simple, Strength + Survival or Strength + Larceny, threshold 0

By spending a Power Point, the character can tunnel into earth or stone. The depth that a character can descend is equal to the number of hits in meters. Burrowing can be repeated in order to excavate tunnels in a hurry, and Troglodytes often use it for this purpose. 

It is up to the character whether they leave a hole behind themselves; if not, the character can activate this power automatically and at no cost to emerge. If no hole is left behind them, the ground will simply have a slight discoloration, the actual form of the terrain will be unharmed. Such spots radiate magic of the type of the creature hidden inside them. 

#### Devastation
_Passive_

The character's Strength can emanate from many places at once along an object being touched, allowing them to lift very large, awkward and even fragile things without issue. It also allows them to have a blow from their hand or foot repeated many times across a wall or floor, causing it to shatter (which is where the power gets its name). This kind of contact telekinesis is best represented in super hero comics - where characters routinely lift cars by the ends without parts falling off or the ground underneath them giving way. The source of force can be directed out across a distance of 2 meters per Potency, and the character can effectively lift or smash something that they could accomplish with 5 identical friends. With Elder Clout, the number of identical friends increases to 9. When used as an attack, the character can strike multiple enemies in close combat without penalty or attack a single opponent as if they outnumbered them. A character with Devastation can use any weapon they can use at all in one hand with no penalty.

#### Giant Size
_Protean, Mutation_

**Cost:** 4 Power Points

**Action:** Complex, automatic

The character can grow extremely large. When this power is activated they roughly double in size, with a human-sized person expanding to a muscular 3 to 4 meters in height. While in Giant Size, the character has an additional 6 points of Strength, they gain a point of armor, and the base damage of any weapon they use increases by 2 (assuming that it is allowed to grow with them). All of the things that a character wants to grow along with them grow along with them while they are being carried by them, and anything they aren't carrying or that they wish to leave normal size stays normal size.

#### Telekinesis

The character can manipulate things at a distance. Things are moved with a Strength equal to the character's Willpower. Telekinesis is only slightly more accurate than a grabber hand, and does not grant the amazingly devastating effects of leverage you might expect. With intense concentration, telekinesis can be made to perform tiny acts of fine manipulation - like writing something. When used in this manner, telekinesis is tortuously slow and not very strong (Strength 1). Think of dramatic spirit writing scenes from a movie of your choice and how long it takes to write something short like "Murder."

#### War Form
_Protean, Mutation_

**Cost:** 4 Power Points

**Action:** Complex, automatic

By spending 4 Power Points and a Complex Action, the character transforms into a monstrous beast. The specifics of the monstrous beast that they become are chosen and fixed when this discipline is gained. A character's War Form is about a 50% larger than their normal form, and it has claws, or teeth or spines or something that constitutes a 4 damage natural weapon that inflicts Lethal damage. While in War Form, the character's Strength is increased by 3 and their Agility is increased by 2. When a character goes into Frenzy they can (and often do) transform into War Form immediately. This Frenzy-induced transformation takes only a Simple Action and does not cost any Power Points. A Frenzy transformation discount cannot be saved for later - it must be the character's first action upon entering Frenzy to count.

## Discernment
_"You see what you want to see. You hear what you want to hear."_

Discernment is the power to have unusual and enhanced senses. A character with Discernment can perceive what others cannot.

### Basic Discernment

#### Supernatural Senses 
_Inherent_

**Cost:** -

**Action:** Simple, automatic

A character with supernatural senses can enhance their perceptions well beyond human norms. Vision can become telescopic or even function in total darkness; hearing can become acute enough to hear heart beats; smell can become powerful enough to track at a brisk walk; and so on. In general, the character's natural senses will be at least as good as any spyware that they could buy over the counter, so long as that sense could plausibly be applied. Bringing one's senses into the realm of magical badassery also makes one vulnerable to intense sensory input. Bright lights can blind, strong smells can overpower, and loud noises can deafen. While a sense is enhanced, the threshold to resist overstimulation is increased by 2. The character may activate or deactivate the enhancement to any of their senses at will with a Simple action.

#### Aura Perception
_Inherent_

**Cost:** -

**Action:** Simple, automatic (to activate or deactivate)

**Action:** Complex, Intuition + Empathy or Logic + Research vs. 5 - Potency of target/creator (to study and identify auras)

A character using Aura perception can bleed their perceptions into other worlds and see magical forces and beings in other worlds. Activating or deactivating Aura Perception is a Simple Action. While active, a character can perceive creatures nearby in one Otherworld (chosen when the power is activated) if they are currently in the Mortal World, or into the Mortal World if they are in an Otherworld. A character with active Aura Perception can also see clear halos around active Sorceries, supernatural creatures, gateways, magic items, and Luminaries (this property may even be why Luminaries are called that). A character can attempt to identify the Otherworldly aspect and type of a supernatural creature, magic item, or sorcery with an Intuition + Empathy or Logic + Research test, with a threshold of 5 _minus_ the Potency of the target (or the creator of the target). Soul Mask changes what is seen with Aura Perception.

#### Sensory Damper
_Passive_

A character with sensory damper is protected from harmful stimuli such as glare, pepper spray, and loud noises. They are able to dial down their sensations to the point of unobtrusiveness. This can be effectively instantaneous in the case of bright flashes, and highly selective in the case of filtering out noise while listening to a conversation across the room. Such a character can stay conscious regardless of wound level (ignoring pain sufficient to knock them out), but it does not affect wound penalties at all.

### Advanced Discernment

#### Psychometry
_Sorcery_

**Cost:** 1+ Power Point

**Action:** Extended (1 minute), Intuition + Empathy or Logic + Research, net hits to time frame

Psychometry allows a character to view past events by touching and concentrating upon items or people that were involved in those events. The event in question must be described (although that description may well be entirely conversational such as "What happened here?" - in the case of a brutal crime scene, the context makes that description sufficient), and must have taken place within the last month. Seeing farther back into time can requires additional net hits to increase the time frame from a one month basis.

At the MC's discretion, using Psychometry on an object or scene that has extreme emotional resonance automatically reveals a vision of the contributing incidents to the character with no roll required, and then the character may attempt to discover additional information with the threshold increased by one for each such major event that they must in effect "look past".

#### Telepathy
_Passive, Subtle_

**Action:** Extended (variable), Intuition + Empathy or Willpower + Intimidation vs. target Willpower (to read unwilling mind)

A character with Telepathy can communicate mentally with people within line of sight. Voluntary telepathic messages can also be sent and received between people the character knows the name of and who they have touched (regardless of line of sight) so long as they are in the same world and within a number of kilometers equal to the character's Potency. The contents of an unwilling mind can be read, but only with physical contact and difficulty. Telepathy is always on, but mind reading is an Extended Action that requires a test if they target resists. If the target understands telepathy and takes effort to obscure details and engages in counter thought, they can use Willpower + Intimidation or Intuition + a relevant Background for resistance. Telepathy is unnoticeable except to those receiving a communication.

| Net Hits | Thought is... |
|:--------:|:--------------|
| **1** | On the surface |
| **2** | Important |
| **3** | Unimportant to the target |
| **5** | Something the target does not know they know. |

| Base Time | Thought is... |
|:----------|:--------------|
| 1 minute | A simple fact. |
| 5 minutes | A mental image. |
| 20 minutes | A short narrative. |
| 1 hour | An involved explanation. |
| 5 hours | The whole story. |
| 1 day | Their life story. |

#### Tracking Echoes of the Muse
_Inherent_

**Cost:** 1 Power Point

**Action:** Reflexive, automatic

Whenever the character is exposed to sensory stimuli, they can spend a Power Point to know where it came from. So if they hear a phrase, even over a telephone or from a recording, they can know where in the world it was spoken. By seeing a picture, they can know where it was painted. And so on.

## Fortitude
_Endure. And in enduring, grow strong._

Fortitude is the power to resist destruction. Some powers of Fortitude are continuously in operation, while others must be activated with Power Points. What makes Fortitude special is that it does not require the _active_ choice to activate it. A character may activate their Fortitude powers passively while unconscious, or in some cases even while _dead_.

### Basic Fortitude

#### Armored in Life
_Inherent, Passive_

**Cost:** 1 Power Point per point of Armor per Scene

**Action:** Reflexive, automatic

What passes for the flesh of monsters is often supernaturally tough stuff. A character with Armored in Life is generally resilient even when not actively using their Fortitude, gaining Armor equal to their Potency. This resistance can be reactively increased for a Scene by paying for additional Armor with Power Points on a one-for-one basis whenever the character needs to soak damage, up to the character's potency.

#### Patience of the Mountains
_Passive_

The character does not need to eat, drink, or breathe. They persist night after night as the mountains and valleys do: never aging or decaying. Such a character can hold any position no matter how awkward without cramping or moving. They are immune to poison. This ability is continuous. The character is still able to learn and change, and indeed Leviathan classically become substantially less human as time moves on.

#### Revive the Flesh
_Blatant, Inherent_

**Cost:** 1 Power Point per 1 Lethal or 2 Normal damage, or 2 Power Points per Aggravated damage

**Action:** Reflexive, automatic

The character can heal their wounds by drawing upon their magical power. When this power is used the character's wounds suture themselves, restoring their body to its original condition without mark or scar. Each Power Point heals one box of Lethal or two boxes of Normal damage. Wounds are healed practically instantaneously. Any wounds short of death can be healed in this manner.

### Advanced Fortitude

#### Adaptive Resilience
_Inherent_

**Cost:** 1 Power Point

**Action:** Reflexive, automatic

The character can make themselves highly resistant to a threat that they are exposed to. Whenever the character makes a resistance test (including a Soak Test) against something, they can reactively use this power to gain 3 extra bonus hits on all future resistance tests against that type of thing (this does not apply to the resistance test that triggers the power in the first place). The adaptive resistance continues to function until it is again activated against a new threat.

#### Cleanse the Body
_Blatant, Sorcery_

**Cost:** 1 Power Point per 1 Lethal or 2 Normal wounds, or 2 Power Points per Aggravated wound

**Action:** Complex or Extended (10 minutes), automatic

The character may spend Power Points to heal wounds of others. One Complex Action and a Power Point will heal two Normal or one Lethal wound. An aggravated wound takes 10 minutes and 2 Power Points to heal. This power requires that the character be within Short range and is eerie to see. Once the character has healed at least one box of damage they can choose to continue healing more wounds on the same target with a Free Action each round.

#### Flesh of Marble
_Blatant, Mutation, Protean_

**Cost:** 2 Power Points

**Action:** Simple, automatic

The character can transform their skin into something very hard. It is not necessarily marble, or even stone: some creatures turn into metal or magically hardened wood. Some creatures get skin that is all craggy or jointed (like The Thing or Colossus from Marvel Comics), and others simply turn into what are apparently living statues. While active, the character gains 4 bonus dice when Soaking physical damage and their Strength increases by 2. Electricity does not harm a character having invoked Flesh of Marble, either because they are too conductive (if metallic) or too insulated (if stone).

#### Restoration
_Blatant_

**Cost:** 1 Power Point per Potency

**Action:** Extended (1 day), automatic

Death is no longer an insurmountable obstacle. While the character is dead they may activate this power to reduce the amount of damage on themselves to one less than Lethal. Even if the character lacks the Power Points to activate this Restoration, they may get a chance if someone else is able to directly provide them with Gift of Health.

Restoration cannot be performed if any of the following circumstances hold:

 * the character's body has been impaled with something that inflicts aggravated damage
 * gross separation of the head and heart
 * subject to their monstrous weakness
 * the character's body is covered with a powder that counters their power source (if dubious, consider this discipline to be the equivalent of Sorcery with 3 hits to be dispelled)

Even if these conditions occur, it may be possible to remove them and invest the remains with power to allow Restoration to proceed.

#### Indomitability
_Covert, Passive_

Wounds and fatigue do not hamper the character. The character suffers no wound penalties, does not go unconscious from injury before they die, and is not affected by the Incapacitated status at all. If you have a Terminal wound you'll still bleed out, and you can still be killed outright by Death Threshold overflow, but you'll be conscious and able to act while that's all happening. The character is also capable of straining themselves severely without noticeable effect: they can carry home anything they can lift.

## Magnetism
_Alright everyone! Let's hear it... for me!_

Magnetism is the power to affect others with the otherworldly charisma of the supernatural, either to attract or repel. A character using 
Magnetism makes a large impression, and anyone asking about them later will sure to find lots of keen witnesses.

### Basic Magnetism

#### Attract

**Cost:** -

**Action:** Complex, Charisma + Tactics or Willpower + Expression (hits to number affected)

The character can "turn on the charm" and grab someone's undivided attention. Activating Attract affects as many people as you get hits and lasts for an entire scene. Attract does not guaranty that someone will agree with you, nor does it guaranty that they will sleep with you. But it does guaranty that the target will not ignore you or discount the importance of what you say. Attracted onlookers do not actively resist the next Adjacent attack if it comes from anyone else (meaning th threshold to hit them is zero).

#### Repel

**Cost:** -

**Action:** Simple, Charisma + Tactics or Willpower + Intimidation vs. target Willpower or Strength

The character can become extremely frightening and intimidating, inspiring fear and shame in onlookers. An affected victim runs away or cowers in terror for at least a number of rounds equal to the net hits. Thereafter, an affected victim is shaken up for the remainder of the scene and suffers a -2 die morale penalty on actions. Repel can be disrupted as if it were a Sorcery with a power source identical to the character using it.

### Advanced Magnetism

#### Betrayal of the Tongue
_Covert_

**Cost:** 1 Power Point

**Action:** Complex, Charisma + Operations or Willpower + Intimidation vs. target Intuition (net hits to duration)

An affected target cannot speak lies. They do not have to speak at all, but if they do, the complete truth as they understand it will pour forth from them on any subject they attempt to hold discourse upon. Placing this curse on someone lasts one hour, with net hits increasing the time frame. The power itself is totally covert.

#### Mien of Power

**Cost:** 3 Power Points

**Action:** Simple, Charisma + Tactics or Willpower + Intimidation

The character can wrap themselves in the air of invincible unapproachability, making aggression against them or even refusal of their demands almost unthinkable. When activated the character's powerful demeanor takes hold until the end of the scene. Anyone who wishes to summon the nerve to act against them must generate an equal number of hits on a Willpower + Intimidation or Willpower + Survival test. Failure to do so results in a round lost to dithering. The character's orders are also extremely likely to be obeyed (especially if they involve moving away from the issuer), and the hits are added as a bonus dicepool on any Intimidation or Tactics tests to command or demand.

#### Shorten the Fuse
_Sorcery_

**Cost:** 1 Power Point, or 2 on targets without a Master Passion

**Action:** Complex, Charisma + Intimidation or Willpower + Survival vs. target Willpower

The character can weaken the resolve and composure of the subject, sending them into a frenzy of destructiveness or a panic as the case may be. If successful, the target loses their cool completely and enters a Fear or Rage frenzy (whichever is most appropriate to the circumstances). The net hits are the strength of the Frenzy.

#### Summons 
_Sorcery_

**Cost:** 2 Power Points

**Action:** Complex, automatic 

**Action:** Charisma + Bureaucracy or Charisma + Empathy vs. target Logic (net hits to duration)

The character can send a brief telepathic message (able to be said in about 12 seconds) to someone whose name they know so long as that person is in the same world and no more than 10 kilometers away per point of the character's Potency. The target can then send back a brief reply. The target's presence may also be demanded by making an opposed test. If successful, the target becomes aware of where the character basically is, and must attempt to figure out how to get there themselves. This compulsion lasts for one day with net hits increasing duration. A Summons can be disrupted at the summoning character _or_ the target.

## Guise
_Virtue has a veil, vice a mask._

Guise is the ability to draw upon one's magical nature to obscure things from view. Guise does not usually affect cameras or other objective traces of a creature's passing, merely prevents observers (even indirect observers) from _noticing_ what is there. Normally, Guise can only take effect while the target is not being observed. If observation is continuous, the observers will not see any change. Onlookers do not normally have any say in what they see as presented to them by Guise any more than they have any choice to not see things that are actually there. Characters who have Discernment powers active or who carefully search the area that the character is in have a chance to perceive through it by making an Intuition + Perception test against the number of hits made to activate the power. Anything a character covered by Guise carries is likewise covered by Guise and anything that the character stops carrying will cease being covered by Guise. An onlooker who notices an object pass into or out of Guise pierces the Guise altogether. Guise is inherently multi-sensory, onlookers are just as fooled if they close their eyes and listen or try to smell the character as they are relying entirely on their eyes.

### Basic Guise

#### Hide From Notice
_Covert_

**Cost:** -

**Action:** Simple, Agility + Stealth or Intuition + Survival

While active, the character is not noticed so long as they don't do anything incredibly obvious to give themselves away. Hide From Notice can be disrupted as if it were a Sorcery with a power source identical to the character using it.

#### Mask of a Thousand Faces
_Covert_

**Cost:** -

**Action:** Simple, Agility + Stealth or Charisma + Larceny

While active, those who meet the character will treat them as if they were a different person. The character may choose the appearance (including clothing and carried items) freely, but taking any action that would be impossible for the facade allows onlookers to see through the illusion. For example, if a character uses the Mask to appear as a person who had no gun and then _fires_ their gun, people would see them as they really are.

### Advanced Guise

#### Façade of Nonchalance
_Covert_

**Cost:** 1 Power Point per Scene

**Action:** Free, Charisma + Larceny or Intuition + Survival

When activated, the façade prevents extras in the area from _noticing_ that events going on around them are in any way out of the ordinary. When activated everyone in the vicinity behaves as if things are totally normal for the rest of the scene even if the actual events are completely outside their life experience or moral limits. In addition to normal ways to penetrate a Guise, taking actual damage will snap a victim out of their complacency. The Façade has to be used _before_ the shit hits the fan, because it won't cause people who have already freaked out to calm down.

#### Holistic Ventriloquism

The character can have the sounds and images generated by their presence shift in apparent origin by up to 2 meters. For creatures viewing them, this power can be seen through by the same criteria as any use of Guise, but it fools cameras and recording devices completely. In many cases, the character can become completely invisible and avoid detection by cameras altogether by shifting their image into a wall or the ground.

#### Lost and Found
_Covert_

**Cost:** 1 Power Point

**Action:** Free, Agility + Stealth or Intuition + Larceny (net hits to duration)

By spending a Power Point, a carried object can continue being covered by Guise after it leaves physical contact with the character. The Guise remains affecting the object for an hour (time frame increases with additional hits). Lost and Found can be disrupted as if it were a Sorcery with a power source identical to the character using it.

#### Hide in Plain Sight
_Passive_

**Cost:** 1 Power Point

By spending a Power Point, the character may activate other powers of Guise while being observed. All onlookers are entitled to a resistance check as if they had been carefully searching the area, but if they fail to notice the discrepancy, their mind will fill in vague details that excuse the character's disappearance.
