## Wounds
_"Okay, that hurt."_

When a character would take damage, they are usually allowed to soak that
damage. This involves rolling a Resistance Test (normally Strength), with the
hits subtracted from the incoming damage. If the damage is reduced to zero, the
character takes no perceptible harm, otherwise they suffer a wound. Some number
of boxes of the character's condition monitor will be filled up. All characters
and objects have 10 boxes on their condition monitor. When boxes are filled in,
they are marked depending on the type of damage that caused the wound:

| Damage Type | Box |
|:-|:-:|
| Normal | <tt>[/]</tt> |
| Lethal | <tt>[X]</tt> |
| Aggravated | <tt>[<s>X</s>]</tt> |

For ease of accounting, the game arranges all wound marks in the order of
Aggravated, then Lethal, then Normal. As new wound marks of any type accumulate
they push lesser marks to the right of the track. If a damage mark would be
pushed off of the track entirely simply discard it. The only exception to this
is if a character's track is already entirely filled with Normal marks when you
start adding a Normal wound: in that case you should convert existing Normal
marks into Lethal marks on a one-for-one basis.

When all 10 of a character's boxes fill up with any kind of damage they are
**Incapacitated**. They might or might not be conscious, but they cannot attempt
any action that requires a dice roll, and they can at best crawl around at a
Slow speed.

* If the character's rightmost box is filled in with a forward slash
  (<tt>[/]</tt>), they are in no immediate danger (at least not from their
  wounds, being incapacitated in a place where you just _took_ a wound implies a
  certain level of urgency in most cases).
* If the character's rightmost box is filled in with a back slash
  (<tt>[\\]</tt>), they gain the Dying condition with one hour to live (see the
  [Healing and Death](healing_and_death.md) section). This usually comes
  directly from Lethal or Aggravated wounds, but note that wound marks heal
  separately so it's possible to have just the back slash itself.

A character can also suffer a Terminal wound, which is much like an
Incapacitating wound (in that all of your condition boxes will be filled up with
a mark), but the character gains the Dying condition with only 5 minutes to
live. Even a Normal damage attack can cause a Terminal wound (eg: an unlucky
rubber bullet or boxer's punch), and then someone had better be on hand with CPR
or the curtain is coming down.

| Net Damage | Wound Type | Wound Boxes |
|:----------:|:-----------|:------------|
| 1 | **P**etty Wounds | 1 Box |
| 2 | **O**rdinary Wounds | 3 Boxes |
| 3 | **S**erious Wounds | 6 Boxes |
| 4 | **I**ncapacitating Wounds | All 10 Boxes |
| 5 | **T**erminal Wounds | All 10 Boxes\* |
| 6 | **T**erminal Wounds | All 10 Boxes\* |
| 7 | **T**erminal Wounds | All 10 Boxes\* |
| 8+ | **D**eath | NA |

\* Also, you are probably going to die.

* **Petty Wounds:** A scratch. Will stop bleeding in a minute, and heal
  completely in a day. May still get infected or transmit poison.
* **Ordinary Wounds:** These are painful and physically debilitating, but they
  generally heal up without much more than a discoloration at the spot, though
  they will take many days to do so.
* **Serious Wounds:** People who see a serious wound inflicted generally wince,
  and the agony and pure physical hampering it causes will generally strike
  mortal terror into the sane.
* **Incapacitating Wounds:** An incapacitating wound is called that because it
  incapacitates the victim. They may or may not lose consciousness, but they
  will be unable to stand even if they are able to keep their eyes open.
* **Terminal Wounds:** Your ass is dying. Not dead, but nothing short of a
  miracle and a pair of lightning paddles is going to save you now.
* **Death:** A character who receives 8 unsoaked damage from a single attack
  simply dies outright. Feel free to describe graphic injuries such as exploding
  heads and bodies torn in half.

### Damage Penalties

When a character has been _recently_ damaged, their ability to act is extremely
impaired. The character's actions take a penalty equal to the number of boxes on
their condition monitor that have a forward slash (<tt>[/]</tt>). This includes
any Normal (<tt>[/]</tt>), Lethal (<tt>[X]</tt>) or Aggravated
(<tt>[<s>X</s>]</tt>) wound boxes.

For every point that a character's Willpower exceeds 2, they can ignore one
point of wound penalty. For example, a character with a Willpower of 4 can
ignore the wound penalties imposed by 2 of their boxes.

A character with the Indomitably power ignores wound penalties completely.
