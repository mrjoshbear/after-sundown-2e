## Temporary Conditions

_"Just as water has no constant shape, so there are no constant conditions."_

The following is a sample set of conditions that might transiently affect a character in After Sundown games. These conditions are generic cases, a character can be "more Delusional" or whatever, in which case the raw numerics of the effect should be increased.

### Condition Descriptions

#### Agony

The victim is in incredible wracking pain. Their Wound penalties are calculated as if they had two more boxes filled in than they do with Normal marks, up to a maximum of all boxes filled. Sensory Damper and Indomitability prevent the penalties of Agony.

#### Amnesia

Drinking to the point of blacking out will cause a man to lose an evening, and in game terms when a character is not going to remember things they are operating under Amnesia. In the real world there are many ways to get to this state, most of which involve chemicals. When a character is operating under Amnesia they suffer a -2 dicepool penalty to actions and the threshold to resist acting impulsively (including succumbing to Frenzy) is increased by 1. Also remember that the character _won't_ remember anything, so it can sometimes be a good narrative tool to skip ahead in the story and then go back and roleplay those events later as a flashback.

#### Anesthetic

The character is neither bothered by, nor aware of, noxious stimuli. That means that pain doesn't bother them, but they also miss things that an unaffected person would notice. The character calculates Wound penalties as if two less boxes were filled in, but the character is at -2 dice on Perception or Empathy tests.

#### Blindness

The character cannot see. Without practice navigating by other senses, the character has difficulty even moving around and treats everything as difficult ground if moving at more than a Careful pace. The character's attacks are penalized by 3 dice and their difficulty perceiving attacks lowers the threshold to hit them at Adjacent range by 1. Many of these penalties can be reduced or obviated by Discernment powers that enhance the character's other senses.

#### Deafness

The character cannot hear. Primarily, this means they can't hear what anyone is saying, but they may be able to get the gist from body language or lipreading. If not used to silence being Deafened can be disorienting, but one of the primary concerns is that a character will not be aware of any attacks they cannot see or feel and thus do not get their normal defense threshold or ability to Dodge those attacks.

#### Delusion

When a character is afflicted by Delusion they respond to things in an irrational fashion. Sometimes this can be well articulated as in the case where a character hallucinates tiny shapes moving in their peripheral vision they'll jump at shadows and, as they acclimatize themselves to their situation, _ignore_ actual moving objects. And that just looks disconcerting to other people. Sometimes a character's delusions will be harder to articulate, but they will be no less disconcerting to those around them. A character suffering from Delusions is opposed on all Social tests by 3 dice. And yes, they can end up with negative hits.

#### Fatigue

A character who is fatigued has a great deal of difficulty exerting themselves or remaining alert. They cannot Run or Sprint. Their effective Strength is reduced by 1. And yes, that means that their Soak is reduced. When the body's reserves are exhausted, they are more vulnerable. Finally, if not actively engaged the character has difficulty remaining awake and alert and can easily fall asleep.

#### Incapacitated

Physical damage or other problems have almost completely disabled the character. They might or might not be conscious, but they cannot attempt any action that requires a dice roll, and they can at best move at a Crawl.

#### Maimed

Physical or neurological damage has rendered part of the character's body unusable. A character with a maimed leg can at best move at a Careful pace; with two maimed legs they are restricted to a crawl (assuming they only have two; Eightfold Grasp still helps). A maimed arm cannot be used to hold anything or make attacks (unless you tear it off and hit someone with it). A maimed head could result in the character being Blinded, Deafened, or Mute. A Maim can be resolved with an application of Revive the Flesh, but if magical healing is not an option substantial medical intervention is required.

#### Overstimulation

When a character's sensory input is greater than their ability to handle that sensory input, it can be disorienting and paralyzing. Usually this comes from being exposed to really bright lights or loud noises, such as those produced by a flashbang grenade. But it can also come from within by having a character's senses sensitized (such as from atropine, ecstasy, or the bite of a Strigoi). In any case, when a character is Overstimulated their Initiative is reduced by 2 and their physical actions suffer a -2 dicepool penalty. The character also needs to make an Intuition + Perception test with a threshold of 2 to even target specific things in the overstimulated sense. A character who is primed to be overstimulated (by a poison or by enhancing their own senses) is not penalized until they are actually confronted with bright lights or equivalent stimuli.

#### Panic

A panicked character is experiencing intense fear that is overwhelming their reason. Panic largely limits the character to basic fight/flight/freeze actions. Any Logic tests the character takes are penalized by -4 dice, as are any Charisma tests to do more than fawn at a source of danger. Most supernatural monsters will go into Frenzy when panicked.

#### Paralysis

A fully paralyzed character cannot move. They may or may not be able to move their eyes or blink, depending upon which is more horrible, but they cannot move their arms or even turn their head. The victim's Agility is zero. Paralysis often goes away gradually, with a victim regaining their Agility one point at a time. Severe paralysis caused by toxins such as curare or particular nerve damage can stop the character's breathing and cause them to suffocate.

#### Stimulation

The character is filled with vigor and energy. Any fatigue or tiredness they feel is postponed until the end of the effect (at which point they will also _become_ fatigued even if they weren't before). The character is incapable of resting during this period.
