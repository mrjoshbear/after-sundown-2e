## Zombies
_"It is a truth universally acknowledged that a zombie in possession of brains must be in want of more brains."_

Zombies are physical bodies without the benefit of life or human spirit who nonetheless move about and hunger for the brains of the living. They are not respected members of the supernatural community, but are instead treated as servitors and disposable soldiers by those with necromantic powers and a social problem by most everyone else. Zombies are not traditionally considered playable, but are instead most likely to appear as tools or independent menaces in an After Sundown campaign.

All Zombies, regardless of strength, have an Orphic power source. When an extra becomes a Zombie, they become a Shambler or a Soulless depending upon the circumstances of their transformation. When a Luminary becomes a Zombie, they become a Revenant in all cases. Unlike many unplayable types, a Zombie _is_ made out of a human being and they _are_ a template added to a normal human statline.

### Shamblers
_"When the dead rise, civilization will fall."_

Shamblers are the classic "slow zombies" from zombie movies from the eighties. They hunger for brains, but they are basically walking corpses who shamble around - hence the name. Shamblers are _not_ individually particularly dangerous. But they _are_ implacable and they can come in fairly large numbers. Created by Orphic sorcery or by leakage of power from Mictlan, Shamblers will thoughtlessly move toward humans and attempt to eat their brains. The opening up of a major Well to Mictlan is often accompanied by the mass animation of large numbers of corpses as Shamblers, leading to potentially terrifying armies of the things even in the face of the relative incompetence of any solitary Shambler.

A Shambler has no Charisma or Logic score and automatically fails any test it would be called upon to make. Upon creation, a Shambler's Agility is reduced by one (to a minimum of 1) but their Strength is increased by 1. A Shambler loses their Logic, Charisma, and Willpower attributes and all of their skills, even combat skills. When not controlled magically, they really will simply walk over and relentlessly and unskillfully claw and bite at potential victims with their substantial but undirected strength. Shamblers are not specifically slower than a normal person, but they _always_ move at the rate of a Careful Walk even when ordered to do otherwise. Only their literally endless endurance and willingness to travel unceasingly to find brains gives their aggregate daily travels a frightening total of up to 50 kilometers a day. 

When Shamblers arise after the death of a human infested with the Z-Virus they can continue to spread it, although this tends not to matter to much because they usually try to eat what they kill and thus the infection doesn't spread _too_ quickly. On the other hand, when Mictlan wells open up the evil magic that animates them will continue to work until the gateway itself closes. 

The skin of a Shambler is quite resilient and hard, and their fists are Damage 1N weapons. Shamblers have no passions, but their behavior is in some ways comparable to a very slow Master Passion Hunger frenzy. A few Shamblers end up with powers such as Vigor or Armored in Life, or Bite of the Serpent (Necrotic).

A Shambler has an Orphic power source, a Feeding Power Schedule, and a Potency of 1, although most never need Power Points. They never have an Edge attribute. As undead they are vulnerable to wood and weakened by sunlight.

### Soulless
_"If you look at the whole life of the planet, we... you know, man, has only been around for a few blinks of an eye. So if the infection wipes us all out, that is a return to normality."_

The Soulless are the lately fashionable "fast zombies" of more modern cinema such as 28 Days Later and the Dawn of the Dead remake. Clearly distinct from Shamblers by their bright red eyes and relatively speedy disposition, the Soulless are neither plodding nor tireless. Possessed of more humanlike speeds and faculties, the Soulless are individually much more terrifying than a Shambler. But while they are rarely spawned in the tremendous numbers of Shamblers, the fact that they can and do spread their affliction readily to the living means that their numbers can easily grow out of control if not checked by heroic intervention.

A Soulless loses their Charisma but not their Logic or Willpower. Their near-constant frenzy means they effectively have an extra point of both Strength and Willpower. A Soulless is consumed by rage at all times to the point of complete irrationality, but they are not actually incapable of utilizing tools. While a Soulless will _usually_ opt to empower Vigor to tear down a door rather than attempting to turn the knob, this is a result of their all consuming hatred rather than actual ineptitude on their part. The Soulless fighting style is simple and predictable, but usually effective enough: all Soulless have a Combat skill of 1.

The bite or even _spit_ of the Soulless can corrupt and kill mortals, with the RAGE Virus spreading rapidly. If they are sterilized by any method, any victims they take down will stay inert. Every Soulless is dominated by both Master Passion Rage and will fly into a Rage Frenzy with basically no provocation at all. Triggers include _seeing humans_.

A Soulless has Master Passion Rage with an Orphic power source and a Feeding Power Schedule, and a Potency of 1. As undead they are vulnerable to wood and weakened by sunlight.

### Thrillers
_"I was told there was nothing left. No reason, no conscience, no understanding. Not even the most rudimentary sense of life or death, of good or evil, right or wrong. I met this six-year-old child with this blank, pale, emotionless face, and the blackest eyes, the devil's eyes. I spent eight years trying to reach him, and then another seven trying to keep him locked up because I realized that what was living behind that boy's eyes was purely and simply...evil._

Sometimes people come back from the dead for no seemingly more reason than their love of killing. Maybe the Gloom just spits them back because Death wants them to keep doing their work. These monstrous and immortal serial killers just keep coming back to kill again and again, and not much ever stops them. Syndicates _hate_ these things, because they almost always murder enough people to attract big investigations that start to turn up weird and unexplainable evidence, and they never listen to reason and try to tone it down or keep the killing on the down-low. They have their ritualistic MO and they are going to stick to it, death and society be damned.

Thrillers are disturbingly powerful and it's just possible that a few of them have survived long enough to become elders; like vampires they have a tendency to not stay dead. Although in retrospect they've probably been around for a very long time, Thrillers weren't identified as a distinct type of monster until some troublesome details of the Ripper Killings were examined, and the problem wasn't widely appreciated until the later half of the 20th century when mortal attention to serial killers started to influence supernatural understanding. Syndicates tend to be rather forgiving of things that are done in the name of putting down a Thriller with extreme prejudice - burying the staked heart and brain in separate bags of seeds on different continents is considered merely prudent. 

Thrillers vary in their Master Passion - although Rage seems to be the most common - and some of them are disquietingly emotionless, akin to Evil Plants or Mockeries. Their Driving Passion is almost always to make another kill according to their ritualistic plan, which means some of them restore Luck at an alarming rate. They have an Orphic power source, a Lunar Power Schedule, and a Potency of 2. As undead they are vulnerable to wood and weakened by sunlight.
