<p>The mercurial rain of the Deep Maya has an origin that few can even speculate upon. But whether The Dreamlands represent an intrusion of our subconscious minds into the realm of the physical or the intrusion of an alien realm into our sleeping thoughts, the fact remains that it is a source of power that those who delve deeply into its mysteries can tap. Astral Disciplines are spells and powers that tap into that strange reality. Magic from Maya has a tendency to be as untamed and inhuman as the implacable beasts and plants that inhabit it.</p>
<p>Astral magic disturbs magnetic fields, including that of the Earth itself (at least on a local level), and a skilled augur can track and judge the strength of the magics of the Dreamlands by carefully observing a lodestone.  Astral magic &quot;feels wet&quot; to those who feel its wrath, and indeed it can be countered by judiciously throwing clean salt on it. Salt used in this manner becomes caked and discolored like it had absorbed dirty water.</p>

<p><em>&quot;Be what you want to be until you don't anymore.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Call of the Wild is the sorcerous path of attuning one's self to animals, particularly wild animals (as referenced in the name). For this Discipline &quot;animal&quot; specifically excludes humans and monsters other than Giant Animals unless otherwise noted.</p>

When Beast Form is gained as a fixed ability from a character's supernatural type, the form of the beast is usually predefined (for example, a Nezumi becomes a rat). This ability can be learned again to gain a different form, or Red in Tooth and Claw can be learned to largely remove this restriction. No beast form can be much larger than a human or smaller than a mouse. Some animals are stronger or more agile than a human, but the total bonus to these attributes never exceeds +2. Many animals are <em>much</em> weaker than a human. For example: a Rat Form always has a strength reduced to 1 regardless of the original character's Strength score, and gains a +2 bonus to Agility. For purposes of being countered, Beast Form has 4 hits. As a <em>Passive</em> benefit, the character gains 2 dice on all tests to influence any animal whose form they can assume with this power.</p>

<p><em>Passive, Subtle</em></p>
<p>The character can speak to and understand the speech of beasts. This is invaluable in training and information gathering. But remember that animals do not gain any special understanding of their environment even though they are able to convey their thoughts to the character. Honestly, dogs speak kind of like the dogs from <em>Up!</em> and rats and cats are no better. Most non-mammalian beasts are downright disappointing conversationalists (with exceptions made for some wicked smart non-mammals like crows and octopuses). This does mean that the character can use Authority powers on animals.</p>

<p><em>Blatant, Enchantment, Sorcery</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> 3 Magic Points</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Complex, Charisma + Empathy or Willpower + Survival</p>
<p>The character emits some suitably animalistic noise and calls all creatures of a specific type to their location. The character can only choose one type of animal at a time, and the power reaches out to 100 meters per point of Potency. The number of beasts that come is dependent upon how many of the type of creature that are within the area, and the urgency with which they come and the degree of control the character has over their actions upon their arrival is based on the number of hits achieved on the activation test. When dealing with large or predatory animals, the range of The Beckoning increases to 500 meters per potency. When calling large predatory animals, the range extends to 5 kilometers per point of potency.</p>

<p><strong>Cost:</strong> 1 Magic Point</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Complex, Charisma + Empathy or Willpower + Survival vs. Intuition (net hits to duration)</p>
<p>The character can transform a victim into a beast. This is a humiliating ordeal, and as the target doubtless has little familiarity with their new form is generally quite awkward and difficult for the victim (over and above being transformed into a frog or pig). The victim becomes a beast of the character's choice until the next sunrise or sunset with net hits increase the time frame of a victim's transformation. While this is a Protean power, the usual benefit does not extend to the victim, although the character can return victim to their real form with another use of this power. A character can't be transformed into an animal much larger than their original size, but they can be transformed into something much smaller.</p>

<p><em>Blatant, Enchantment, Sorcery, Protean</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> 4 Magic Points</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Complex, automatic</p>
<p>The character can transform into a large and powerful animal. Otherwise similar to Beast Form, the character can turn into something as large as 500 kg (or 1100 lb), such as a large alligator or polar bear - something more like a Behemoth than an ordinary animal. In such a form the character usually has a natural attack such as a bite that does at least 4 Lethal damage and the character may improve their physical attributes by up to 6 points. The type of animal transformed into is chosen when the ability is learned and may be fixed by the supernatural type. This ability can be learned multiple times, and each time the character can choose one more new form than the time before (two new forms with the second learning, for a total of 3). For purposes of being countered, Beast of Terror has 4 hits.</p>

<p>The character can fill areas with thickening fog that obscures vision and makes things seem really spooky. Range depends on the power invested, from a base of 3 meters per Potency. By spending two Magic Points, they can create an actual weather pattern, with mists creeping in out to a kilometer per Potency from their person. The activation test determines visibility through the mists:</p>

<p><strong>Action:</strong> Complex, automatic</p>
<p>The character can transform themselves into a fine mist. While in mist form, a character's body is essentially impervious to physical attacks, save those that are made with a weapon that the character is vulnerable to. Everything the character is carrying when they transform transforms with them, and other creatures thus transformed are essentially helpless until the character becomes solid again. While in mist form the character can fly, but they move no faster than a normal walk, and can gradually fit through any gap that isn't water-tight. For purposes of being dispelled, Form of Mist has 4 hits.</p>

<p>A cloudy sky can be split by a lightning bolt crashing to Earth. The character can direct a lightning bolt to strike an individual or object. The lightning bolt cannot be dodged, its threshold to hit the target at any range is 2, and it is a Damage 5 weapon. Once unleashed, the bolt of lightning is real electricity, and can be defended against with conductive materials in classic Franklin or Tesla fashion, or with Flesh of Marble. Nearby electronics may be damaged by the induction created by the enormous voltage.</p>

<p>The character can pull clouds into a clear sky and rain from clouds. It takes a base amount of time of an hour to bring rain from a clear sky, and net hits reduce the timeframe. The more it is &quot;naturally&quot; clouded, the easier this is, and the character gains a +2 bonus if there are already clouds <em>somewhere</em> in the sky, raising to a +6 bonus if there is already some tiny amount of rain coming down. The weather can be affected out to 5 kilometers per Potency of the character. Once established, a weather pattern persists until natural forces blow it away.</p>

<p><em>Leaves drop in Autumn not because of the shortening of the day, but because of the lengthening of the night.</em></p>
<p>The Coil of Thorns is the Astral Sorcery dedicated to understanding and manipulating plant life. Characters who practice this magic are able to do much with practically any plant matter. Characters with Coil of Thorns can also make something edible and even delicious out of literally any plant matter. It's not at all obvious how it's done, but their redwood pasta is not bad at all. This magic is inextricably linked in the minds of many supernaturals with the Evil Plants, and indeed any practitioner can speak with Evil Plants of any kind. It has even been suggested that Dryad Witches are actually Pod spies. Most Coil spells are quite powerful but time-consuming to use. A Coil of Thorns laboratory is called a &quot;Kitchen&quot; and can indeed be created with materials purchasable at a farmer's market, or, as is the case with Evil Plants, grown.</p>

<p>The character can make powerful medicines and poisons out of ordinary fruits and roots. By spending a Magic Point and an hour working in a kitchen, the character's result can be a balm or a curse to those who consume it with a strength equal to the number of hits on a Logic + Medicine or Intuition + Survival test. Such products can be made into potions or clearly medicinal pastes and the like, or covertly disguised as fresh foods such as tea cakes or shiny apples. Doses with other effects can also be produced, but if the requisite number of hits is not achieved the resulting product is merely a standard damaging poison with a strength equal to the actual hits achieved. With Advanced and Elder Coil of Thorns comes the learning of additional recipes such as making powerful acids, paralytics, or explosives. The products of Bitter Root may be dispelled, but this does not remove any effect already produced.</p>

<p>The character plants a seed in a victim that slowly roots into the unfortunate's brain and leaves them an emotionless pawn. Creating the Mind Root takes an hour in the kitchen, and it takes an hour or two for the tendrils to work their way into the victim (making it essentially worthless against a target that is not willing, bound, or sleeping). Once fully implanted, the victim becomes zombie-like, taking orders as if the character is using Command, but automatically fails any active Social tests and is incapable of frenzying. Once the Root has taken hold considerable damage to memory and personality has taken place that may not naturally heal, even if dispelled, unless treated with Purify the Mind or other extraordinary measures.</p>

<p>The character can command plants to perform actions and have the plants actually perform them at a reasonable speed. The character's plant minions will move about with distinctly non-plantlike mobility each round the character uses a Complex action to actively to control them with and effective Strength and Agility equal to the character's Intuition or Logic. The character can also give long term commands to plants, which they will go about performing at their normal speeds (often centimeters a day). Commanding sapient (and presumably evil) plants is more difficult, and requires an opposed test to physically control one of them for a number of rounds equal to the number of net hits; this also applies to controlling a person someone else has implanted a Mind Root into. Otherwise, Plant Puppetry extends to any number of plants within 10 meters of the character per point of Potency. A character with Puppetry is able to use their Authority powers on Evil Plants without the usual requirement to make eye contact.</p>

<p><em>Bitterest of all is not the sorrow but to have one's sorrows ignored.</em></p>
<p>The Depths of Despair is a magical discipline which harvests the power of misery. In the Deep Astral there is a liquid that is literally created by the fact that sadness exists. This material is called the Tears of Maya, even though in a very real way it is the psychic residue of human sorrow from the Material World. Those who swim the depths are incredibly good at finding the clouds in life.</p>

<p><strong>Cost:</strong> -</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Simple, Willpower + Rigging or Willpower + Sabotage</p>
<p>Using astral sorcery, the character curses a victim to have luck abandon them at a later date. When placed, evil magic hangs like a dark cloud of misery over the target's head. At any later date, the character may reactively end this curse to force the victim to reroll all hits on a test. The Curse of Failure is totally covert, all the character actually does is look at the victim funny and the sorcery has no overt special effects (although it can be detected as normal Astral magic). If multiple Curses of Failure are laid on a single target, treat them as a single Sorcery with net hits of whichever activation had the most which may be ended by any character that laid one of the curses.</p>
<h4 id="misery-loves-company"><a class="header" href="#misery-loves-company">Misery Loves Company</a></h4>

<p>Tiny drops fall at the target, dampening not their skin but their pride. Pain Drops have a damage rating equal to the character's Willpower, and are soaked with Willpower rather than Strength. Pain Drops cause only illusory damage, and while they cause wound penalties and even incapacitation, they do not actually kill or wrap around into lethal damage. Virtual damage from Pain Drops fades in an hour. Sensory Damper and Indomitability explicitly give total immunity to this damage.</p>

<p><strong>Action:</strong> Extended (1 Hour), Willpower + Intimidate or Willpower + Rigging vs. Willpower (net hits to timeframe)</p>
<p>The Tears of Maya may be harvested into the mortal world through this character's actions. The character observes and concentrates on a person in terrible sadness and despair, who slowly weeps a few milligrams of milky black tears. This precious material must be carefully gathered and protected, for any touch of salt will ruin it utterly (a single success on a Dispelling test breaks the enchantment). Rather than salty and bitter the tears are deliciously sweet and fill the drinker with a subtle ecstasy that soothes the soul. A single dose of the Milk of Human Kindness gives a chance to end a frenzy and eliminates any penalty to frenzy tests for living in human society for one day. They're also as addictive as heroin, the primary sustenance of the Fae, and the only way to make Evil Plants have feelings at all.</p>

The waters and voids of Maya are stranger still, and in the dawning times of the world Dagon mastered them all and left as his children's first birthright a mad insight into the deep and secret places of the worlds.

<p>The character's body adapts automatically to the extremes of the ocean depths and empty space alike. Broad pressure, whether in total absence or crushing abundance, has no adverse affect. Without other powers the character still requires breath, but at only one tenth the normal rate and with the ability to inhale liquids and extract oxygen from them with no more difficulty than surface atmosphere. The extremes of mountain air make no difference to them at all. The character gains 6 points of armor with regard to heat and cold. Finally, they experience no penalty for moving and acting in water or free fall. Abyssal Grace otherwise does not protect a character from the effects of a weakness to water or sunlight, but does continue to function even when the character is subject to their supernatural weakness.</p>
<h4 id="measure-the-stars"><a class="header" href="#measure-the-stars">Measure the Stars</a></h4>

<p>The character's senses are enhanced with an uncanny ability to measure the world around them and otherwise perform stunts of visual calculation and memory. Among other things, the character can flawlessly perform celestial navigation as if equipped with a suite of measuring devices and charts or make accurate land surveys at a glance. This even extends to the strange wheeling stars of the Dreamlands, and the character can navigate into the Deep Maya or back towards the Earth with little difficulty so long as they have stars to navigate by.</p>

<p><strong>Action:</strong> Complex, automatic</p>
<p>The character can grow additional limbs. The particular form of limb is set when learning the power; tentacles are most common, but it could be spider legs, mechanical grabbers, or just more human arms and legs, and the character's existing limbs can be transformed to match if they wish. These extra limbs are especially useful for climbing and swimming and the character can move at their base speed when doing either (multiplied by Nimble Feet as usual). The limbs are also of great use when grappling; the character is treated as being double their usual mass due to their greatly increased leverage and gets a +4 bonus to their Strength + Combat pool when performing a Grab attack. While the Eightfold Grasp can certainly let the character hold more things it doesn't generally speed up most tasks; the character is still somewhat limited in their ability to multitask and coordinate multiple limbs.</p>

<p>With a dismissive gesture the character robs their target of breath and speech. The target's lungs (or parallel organs) are filled with water or collapsed with vacuum at the character's option. In most circumstances this arrests their ability to effectively speak and causes them to begin drowning of suffocating; Abyssal Grace gives total immunity to Drowning Doom, and characters that do not need to breathe will not be fatally affected.</p>

<p>At the character's command water or ice can be manipulated into three-dimensional shapes that hold their form and are strong as steel. Actually capturing someone with the titular prison made of water requires a that the target be within Short range of sufficient water and is resolved as a grab attack, albeit at range. Grasping water has an effective Strength equal to the character's Willpower. A character held by Water Prison is considered fully wet for purposes of magical weaknesses to water.</p>

<p>The mad wisdom of the sea and stars are at the character's disposal, for a price. For each point of Stress the character accepts (up to a limit of their Potency) they may increase either their Intuition or Logic by a point for a scene, and may continue this insight into an additional scene for a flat cost of one Stress. While any normal triggers may send the character into Frenzy during the duration of Starry Wisdom they need not resist the frenzy that the Wisdom causes until its duration is complete unless their accumulated Stress exceeds their Willpower and triggers an automatic frenzy.</p>

<p><strong>Action:</strong> Complex, Intuition + Perception or TK + TK vs. Intuition</p>
<p>The character may share their abyssal insights with others in subtle ways, driving them to apparent insanity. As indicated by its name, Eye of Madness requires eye contact and the character must also speak to the target, but Eye of Madness is treated as an Authority power to transcend these limitations. Affected characters are subject to paranoid delusions for the duration of the power, seeing secret signs of conspiracy and danger in patterns of everyday things around them. Alternatively, the character can attempt to inflict the target with a Master Passion, but those who already have Master Passions add their Potency to their resistance pool as their existing madness asserts itself over any other. The duration of Eye of Madness is one scene, but if the character spends a Magic Point when activating the power the duration increases to a base of one day, which is increased by net hits.</p>

<p>Using astral sorceries the character makes people supernaturally sleepy. The compulsion to sleep is virtually impossible to overcome for people who are already asleep, and is at best a minor inconvenience for those whose adrenaline is pumping. Activating it is potentially covert, in that the target is not especially aware of anything other than a feeling of sleepiness. The character however produces faintly glowing dust from their hands when used. An affected target that is not already asleep will shortly pass out, and any case will not awaken for at least an hour (longer with net hits) even in the face of loud noises or shaking.</p>

The target must be asleep and within 100 meters per hit on the activation test. While so attuned, the character can make themselves appear in the dream or simply voyeuristically watch the proceedings. Denial of Privacy may be used while asleep.</p>
<h4 id="horrid-reality"><a class="header" href="#horrid-reality">Horrid Reality</a></h4>
<p><em>Enchantment, Sorcery</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> 2 Magic Points</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Complex, automatic</p>
<p>The stuff of dreams becomes the stuff of reality. The character spends a Complex Action and suddenly the physical effects of events that take place within a dreamer's dream reality draw their toll on their body. While the effects of a sexy or merely surreal dream may not even be immediately obvious upon waking, the effects of a nightmare can be catastrophically fatal. The character need only know the name of a potential victim and their location while dreaming, the ability works at any distance. The victim can fight back against the invader with whatever is in their dream, but unless they <em>also</em> have Horrid Reality, the only thing they will get from defeating their attacker is to knock them out of their dream until the following sunset. For purposes of dispelling, Horrid Reality has 4 hits. Horrid Reality may be used while asleep.</p>
<h4 id="phantasmagoria"><a class="header" href="#phantasmagoria">Phantasmagoria</a></h4>
<p><em>Enchantment, Sorcery</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> 2 Magic Points</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Complex, Intuition + Artisan or Charisma + Expression vs. Intuition + Empathy or Intuition + Perception</p>
<p>The character can shape the stuff of dreams and bring their creations into the real world as a magical illusion. The character can affect as many of the normal five senses as they wish. The illusion extends to a column with a 3 m radius and height per point of Potency, and it can be moved at any speed out to an area in line of sight by spending a Simple Action per round. The Illusion's contents can be changed to apparently react to events reactively so long as the character can perceive their own illusion and cares. The realistic nature (or not) of the illusion is determined by the test; other characters can spot the weirdness with an appropriate opposed test with a bonus or penalty applied if the illusion is something particularly believable or impossible (to their experience; a werewolf will easily believe someone can turn into a werewolf but might be suspicious if they turn into a dragon). The Illusion normally ends at the end of the scene, but for another Magic Point, the character can leave an Illusion standing until the next sunrise, but binding an Illusion like this makes it unable to be moved (though it can still react to apparent stimuli so long as it remains in its defined area).</p>
