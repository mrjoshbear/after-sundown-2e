<p><em>&quot;We do what we must because we can.&quot;</em></p>
<p>It is important at times to realize that After Sundown is a <em>role playing game</em>, and as such that the characters being played are just <em>characters</em> and not the actual people playing the game. Even though a player will routinely use first-person pronouns to describe a character's activities (for example: &quot;<em>I</em> call the dog to <em>me</em>&quot; or &quot;<em>I</em> bend down and lick the blood off the floor&quot;) the character and the player are different people. The first person pronoun is used as a storytelling and acting device. The use of the first person pronoun helps bring immediacy and sympathy to the characters, but it doesn't actually conflate the character's unique personality traits with those of the player. Conversely, the MC will usually refer to non-player characters in the third person (for example: &quot;The knife cuts deeply into <em>Her</em>&quot; or &quot;<em>Max</em> begins to cry&quot;), and may well refer to player characters in the second person (for example: &quot;The sputtering of the lamp plunges <em>you</em> into darkness&quot;). This is done because the MC has a lot of characters they are controlling, and it is incomprehensible if all of them identify themselves as &quot;me&quot;. But regardless of what pronouns and sentence constructions are employed, the characters are <em>not</em> the same as the players. They have different abilities and a different fate. The characters can even die and it won't be the end of the world for the players. Most importantly, the characters are characters in a story, and they have different motivations from those of the players.</p>
<p>Every character in the story, like every person in real life, has personal beliefs, fears, goals, and habits that act as strings to their marionettes. In After Sundown, these motivations are formalized into Passions, Ethics, and Ideologies. And they can be of great help when determining what a character's likely responses to a situation might be. But the vagaries of circumstances are too complicated for the game rules to cover in total, and so it falls to players to adjudicate what they think their character's actions will be in response to specific events. Not only is this much more immersive and entertaining than simply deterministically generating each character's actions, but it can potentially give a more nuanced, more <em>real</em> response than any table ever could. The fact that each player presumably passes the Turing Test means that they can play a role that <em>also</em> passes the Turing Test. And that's a good thing.</p>
<p>It is unfortunately true that the game world <em>as a whole</em> includes billions of people and most of the background characters will not be given even the barest of motivational sketches. When the characters walk into a 7-11 at 2 in the morning to get Slurpees, it's not super important what the guy behind the counter is doing with his life, chances are that his lines in the play will be the barest of pleasantries and he'll get credited as &quot;7-11 Employee&quot;. But this is not always the case. Events tend to spiral out of control and develop quickly in a roleplaying game, and the players may, for whatever reason, end up conversing with the 7-11 employee for an extended amount of time, bringing his name, his ideals, and his fears to actual importance. For the MC there are two main ways to handle this fact. The first is to simply write a character on the spot, filling in details as they become important. And the second is to have some &quot;templates&quot; - a set of mundane Extras set up in advance that can be slotted into the story whenever some random person in a bank or a crowd becomes important to the story. Random name tables are incredibly useful for this, and the MC should consider getting some.</p>
<h3 id="driving-ambitions-getting-places-and-doing-things"><a class="header" href="#driving-ambitions-getting-places-and-doing-things">Driving Ambitions: Getting Places and Doing Things</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;I'm gonna do it. Just you wait and see.&quot;</em></p>
<p>While most major events in the realm of horror are soul-destroying and oppressive affairs, it is not to be ignored that there are indeed things that motivate people to <em>accomplish</em> things. And while even that silver lining must be tempered with its own dark cloud - that indeed many people in the world are motivated to accomplish despicable things - it remains a source of beauty, industry, and human achievement. Or supernatural inhuman achievement as the case may be. These motivations represent the Muse in all of us, and in After Sundown are described as a character's <em>Driving Ambition</em>.</p>
<p>Accomplishing things governed by the character's Driving Ambition means more to the character than other things. And in the grand tradition of genre fiction, meaningful accomplishments are karmically rewarded. In After Sundown, achievement in accordance with a character's Driving Ambition allows them to refresh an Edge even if it is not the end of the story. Striving to accomplish a character's Driving Ambition can bring out their very best. When a character is near to accomplishing something major with regards to their Driving Ambition and they are faced with difficulty they may - once per story - temporarily increase one of their Physical, Mental, or Social attributes (of their choice) for the duration of the scene. Sometimes it can be wise to refrain from drawing upon this inner awesomeness even when it is available because it can only be used once per story.</p>
<p>A Driving Ambition is like the narrative of the character's life as they would wish it to be. When choosing a Driving Ambition, try to think of what would make the character &quot;live happily ever after&quot; or at least end the chronicle on a positive note. They can be things like &quot;win the love of Isolde&quot; or &quot;get into Law School&quot; or whatever it is that the character's big goal is supposed to be. However, things happen and life goes on even after the love of your life has married you or moved to Cleveland with her personal trainer. Sooner or later a character's Driving Ambition becomes irrelevant. And when that happens, the character either has to go on listlessly with no real Driving Ambition or find something new to propel them forward. Protagonists rarely go long without acquiring a new Driving Ambition.</p>
<p>It is entirely acceptable for characters to have their Driving Ambitions defined reactively by the chronicle. A character might become incensed that the president had been kidnapped by ninjas or cultists were trying to destroy the world and get a Driving Ambition to put a stop to that nonsense. Most adventure stories revolve around characters doing exactly that. However, the MC should check a proposed Driving Ambition to make sure it isn't <em>stupid</em>. A character might be able to advance a goal such as &quot;eat a sandwich&quot;, but that's not appropriate in most chronicles because it is too trivial. Of course, if circumstances are such that such a goal requires genuine striving against genuine difficulties (for example: the character is stuck in Limbo and there appears to be no bread), then by all means go for it.</p>
<h3 id="ethical-taboos-a-line-in-the-sand"><a class="header" href="#ethical-taboos-a-line-in-the-sand">Ethical Taboos: A Line in the Sand</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;I'd do that for a dollar... that I would do for a hundred dollars... that I would not do.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Every person has a set of personal ethics that govern and proscribe how they behave. It is important to distinguish a person's ethics (what they will not do personally) from their ideology (what they prefer to happen). For example: many people want sewage to get treated, but very few people are willing to handle the sewage or be around sewage processing. These kinds of internal contradictions are practically universal and make for great character conflicts and growth possibilities.</p>
<p>But Ethical Taboos aren't purely debilitating, no matter what Nietzsche tells you. In a world with genuine mind control floating around, having arbitrary, even irrational lines that you won't cross can be extremely useful. After all, whatever things you don't want to do are things that you've spent much of your life figuring out how to live <em>without doing</em>, and creatures trying to puppet you around may have no idea what those are, effectively creating minefields of unexpected resistance. Game mechanically, a character whose ethical taboos are brought to the fore increases the threshold to influence them into a course of action by 1 or 2.</p>
<h4 id="princess-ethics"><a class="header" href="#princess-ethics">Princess Ethics</a></h4>
<p><em>&quot;That's horrible and I don't want to look at it.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Many people do not want to look at or participate in things that are ugly or repellent. While they probably have no moral objections to trash being collected, they have an <em>ethical</em> prohibition against doing it themselves. While perhaps not especially praiseworthy according to most ethical calculi, Princess Ethics are reasonably common. The moral of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101414/">Beauty and the Beast</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095182/">The Frog Prince</a>, and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0042332">Cinderella</a> are pretty much all that Princess Ethics are to one degree or another bad; but that should not tell you that Princess Ethics are universally thought poorly of in any society. Indeed, many societies frown on people who abandon Princess Ethics, or even <em>seem</em> to. Just the fact that &quot;Untouchables&quot; exist in many cultures should tell you how prevalent this line of thinking is.</p>
<h4 id="nonviolence-ethics"><a class="header" href="#nonviolence-ethics">Nonviolence Ethics</a></h4>
<p><em>&quot;I can't do that, people could get hurt!&quot;</em></p>
<p>Nonviolence is when <em>you</em> don't hurt or kill things by <em>your</em> actions in a direct way that <em>you</em> can see. This is very often quite a different concern from taking actions that reduce the overall amount of hurt in the world, or even reducing the amount of violence in their area or even reducing the amount of violence done on their personal behalf. For example, while a person with Nonviolence Ethics will not swing a hammer into the skull of a pig, they are often perfectly happy to eat a hotdog. A severe conflict for the follower of Nonviolence Ethics is being attacked since most people want to survive.</p>
<h4 id="politeness-ethics"><a class="header" href="#politeness-ethics">Politeness Ethics</a></h4>
<p><em>&quot;Of course I don't hate you...&quot;</em></p>
<p>Mankind, even supernatural kind continues to persist in no small part because of its ability to get along with itself. And one of the strongest forces making this possible is the capacity for politeness. Each person is expected to defer actions that might offend others. And a lot of people do this pragmatically, not wanting to potentially start shit with random strangers. And a lot of other people find this automatic restriction on their activities is truly part of their being. Insulting others or taking a dump on the table is something they <em>won't</em> do.</p>
<h4 id="privacy-ethics"><a class="header" href="#privacy-ethics">Privacy Ethics</a></h4>
<p><em>&quot;What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas.&quot;</em></p>
<p>The world's panopticon is fairly advanced, with more information collected on each person than any other person could read in a lifetime even if they could find it all in the stacks and stacks of documentation tangled up in other people's lives. And yet, a lot of people don't want to share things about themselves with others. This isn't exactly the same thing as shame, and indeed many people who feel this way are not particularly embarrassed about most of their actions, but simply feel that others knowing about them and especially <em>finding things out</em> about them is an insidious attack. Characters with Privacy Ethics won't talk about their personal life except under the most extreme duress.</p>
<h4 id="frugality-ethics"><a class="header" href="#frugality-ethics">Frugality Ethics</a></h4>
<p><em>&quot;I've got food at home. That hotdog guy is not getting my dollar.&quot;</em></p>
<p>The very nature of expending things is that once that has been done, the thing is expended. This finality is a source of genuine fear for a lot of people. The idea of not being able to use something later can be virtually paralyzing. People with Frugality Ethics are opposed to giving up things, even though by <em>never</em> using an opportunity or good it is in fact <em>very similar</em> to never having had it at all.</p>
<h4 id="hacker-ethics"><a class="header" href="#hacker-ethics">Hacker Ethics</a></h4>
<p><em>&quot;I may not like what you say, but I'd be modestly upset if someone stopped you from saying it.&quot;</em></p>
<p>People who have Hacker Ethics don't like being told to shut up and they don't like getting rid of DVDs that they haven't watched yet. In a larger sense, they feel that <em>information</em> has a life of its own and should be enabled whenever possible. Hacker Ethics provokes people to have a gut reaction of horror to censorship, even if the ideas being censored are ones they are violently opposed to.</p>
<h4 id="solidarity-ethics"><a class="header" href="#solidarity-ethics">Solidarity Ethics</a></h4>
<p><em>&quot;I don't care what he done, I ain't no snitch.&quot;</em></p>
<p>People who have Solidarity Ethics don't want to take actions that betray people. This is not the same as doing their 'duty' or holding up their ends of bargains. So for example, they would be reluctant to turn in one of their friends to the police or even tell another one of their friends that a third friend had wronged them. Passive betrayal, such as merely allowing a third party to harm an ally is not a violation. Solidarity Ethics are quite common among lower classes or persecuted minorities.</p>
<h4 id="other-taboos"><a class="header" href="#other-taboos">Other Taboos</a></h4>
<p><em>&quot;Whatever this is, I am not eating it.&quot;</em></p>
<p>There are so many possibilities for ethical taboos that they are quite likely infinite. And it is encouraged for players and MCs alike to make new and specific ethical frameworks for individual characters. Remember that ethics need not be adaptive or even &quot;good&quot;, they are simply things that characters have a mental block against doing. In the real world, some people have taboos against treating people of other ethnicities as equals or treating a woman with respect. These can appear on a character sheet as &quot;Racist Ethics&quot; or &quot;Sexist Ethics&quot; or whatever. And it is important to note that while these may be a character flaw, they are also an important facet of the character's personality. Ethics are a good way to describe the good and the bad about a character, and to flesh them out more fully as a human (or monster).</p>
<h3 id="ideology"><a class="header" href="#ideology">Ideology</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;It is everyone's goal to have things be more like the way they wish that they were.&quot;</em></p>
<p>When we use the word ideology, we naturally think of the big political, religious, and economic ideologies that have shaped the 20th century and created the world we live in. But while the demands and counter demands of Imperialism, Capitalism, Fascism, Communism, and Fundamentalism have certainly torn the world apart and put it back together in a form that would be both unrecognizable and incomprehensible to the people of even the 1800s, these kinds of big ideas are generally not supported monolithically by nations or even individuals. There are few people indeed that argue for pure fundamentalism in any real way (even the Amish make concessions to modern medicine sometimes), and when someone argues for completely pure Capitalism or Communism without intrusion by the other we call them ideologues for a reason.</p>
<p>But beyond that, the fact of the matter is that most people don't actually <em>care</em> how it is decided what plots of land will grow lettuce or how it is determined where that lettuce goes to be distributed to various kitchens and delivered ultimately to salad plates. It's not the kind of thing most people think about <em>at all</em>. So when we talk about Ideologies of characters, we are not particularly concerning ourselves with the character's personal beliefs on the extent to which the public should be invested into the oversight of and decision-making process that determines the production and distribution of agricultural products, or what form that extent of public interest should take in terms of participation and representation of individuals. We're talking about what people think <em>they</em> should be doing and even more importantly, what they think <em>other people</em> should be doing in their immediate vicinity. A character's ideology determines what actions they find praiseworthy, and what actions they condemn. Some characters think that a person going to war is praiseworthy because it is <em>brave</em>, others because it shows <em>commitment</em>, and still others because it involves <em>killing those people over there</em>. On the other hand, different people think that a person going to war is disappointing because it is <em>violent</em>, others because it implies <em>support for the current regime</em>, and still others because it involves <em>killing those people over there</em>. Every action you can take can be lauded or condemned by rational people for facets about it that are essentially identical. There is truly nothing that a man can do (including nothing) that can be universally seen as good or bad.</p>
<p>A character's Ideology should be ranked, what are the things that people could do that would most offend your character's sensibilities? What are the things that people could do that would most impress your character with that person's virtue? Note that this is the character's <em>actual</em> visceral responses, not the answers they would give to a questionnaire that others might read. Lots of people <em>say</em> they think the ten commandments are important, but how many people are in reality more offended by rape (which is not against any of the ten commandments) than by carving statues (which is)? A good start would be to write up twelve things: six things that your character would be impressed by, and six things that your character would be offended by. Note that just because a character has an ethical taboo against doing something <em>does not</em> mean that they lose respect for other people who do those things. It really can go either way. A character with Princess Ethics might be in awe of people who have the courage to squash bugs and turn to them for help. On the other hand, another character with Princess Ethics may feel that people who do gross things <em>have cooties</em> and thus not want to touch them or be near them for fear of having to think about the gross things that they do. It is entirely common for there to be contradictions available, where the character looks at the same action from two or more angles and gets different decisions on whether something should be honored or despised. For example: Eric is a pretty chivalrous guy, and likes to think of himself as an especially manly man. He's wary of people who aren't religious or who don't conform to his expectations of gender roles.</p>
<ul>
<li>Honor: bravery, confidence, pulling your weight, holding your liquor, knowing sports trivia, women who dress sexy.</li>
<li>Despise: hurting women, acting gay, renouncing Christianity, hurting people for extended periods of time, snitching to the cops, making things ugly</li>
</ul>
<p>In general, if a character is being influenced towards or by something that they honor in their ideology, the threshold to do so is reduced by one. If the character is being influenced towards or by something they despise, the threshold is increased by one. And these changes are naturally reversed if they are being influenced against or to reject things that they honor or despise.</p>
<h3 id="changing-ideologies"><a class="header" href="#changing-ideologies">Changing Ideologies</a></h3>
<p><em>That was me then, this is me now.</em></p>
<p>Ideologies do not stay static over time. Characters can be convinced through persuasive argumentation that things they thought were good were bad, or that things they thought were bad are actually good. People can be quite resistant to change, and often someone convinced that something is good will just go ahead and continue hating it <em>out of habit</em>. Even if someone agrees on an intellectual level that a group of people is in fact producing more for the economy than they are costing in civil services doesn't mean that they necessarily start liking that group of people, or even stop hating them. Indeed, prejudices run pretty deep and it is entirely frequent for a person to continue parroting arguments <em>they themselves no longer believe</em> rather than abandon ideological positions they've held onto for a long time.</p>
<p>But change <em>does</em> happen. Characters in an After Sundown game are often exposed to tremendously life-changing events, and they <em>do</em> change their lives and their goals in response to them. If you've noticed people changing their political affiliations because their son came out as a homosexual or they lost their job due to plant closings, imagine how complete the turnaround can be when a person finds themselves as a member of the living dead who drink human blood to persist from night to night.</p>
