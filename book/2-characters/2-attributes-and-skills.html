<h3 id="basic-attributes-physical-mental-and-social"><a class="header" href="#basic-attributes-physical-mental-and-social">Basic Attributes: Physical, Mental, and Social</a></h3>
<p>Characters in After Sundown have six basic attributes that are divided into Physical, Mental, and Social attributes. These basic attributes range in value between 4 and 9 for normal humans.</p>
<h4 id="physical-attributes"><a class="header" href="#physical-attributes">Physical Attributes</a></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strength:</strong> Strength determines how physically strong <em>and</em> tough you are.</li>
<li><strong>Agility:</strong> Agility is a combination of precision and speed.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="mental-attributes"><a class="header" href="#mental-attributes">Mental Attributes</a></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intuition:</strong> Intuition is a combination of empathic and physical perception.</li>
<li><strong>Logic:</strong> Logic is a combination of problem-solving know-how and logical intelligence.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="social-attributes"><a class="header" href="#social-attributes">Social Attributes</a></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Willpower:</strong> Willpower is a combination of determination and domination.</li>
<li><strong>Charisma:</strong> Charisma is one's ability to convince and ingratiate.</li>
</ul>
<p>The primary purpose of basic attributes is to set the dicepools for actions. A character with a high Agility will have a bunch of extra dice to roll for every skill test that invokes Agility. A character with a high Charisma will have extra dice on every test that uses Charisma, and so on. A character's basic attributes represent a broad aptitude in a wide variety of actions.</p>

<p>Edge and Potency are attributes that not all characters have. Having any rating in Edge or Potency is what sets extraordinary or supernatural characters above the mortal Extras in the background.</p>
<p><strong>Edge</strong> is a measure of the extraordinary fate or narrative importance that Luminaries have. Extras have an Edge of zero, while Luminaries have an Edge of at least 1, and usually 3 or sometimes higher.</p>
<p>An important thing that Edge also does is that it adds to Resistance Rolls. Whenever an ability says that the target resists with their Strength or Willpower (or whatever) you can assume that it means &quot;plus Edge if the target is a Luminary and actually has an Edge stat&quot;, sort-of as if it were a Skill for generally resisting harm and other unwanted effects.</p>
<p>Every two points of Edge a character has increases the absolute maximum they can raise their skills to during play. While characters start with skill ratings of 6 or less, a character with an Edge of 2 or 3 can eventually raise them to 7, while a character with an Edge of 4 or 5 could raise their skills to 8. A character with an Edge of 6 can potentially get a skill of 9. Six is the maximum Edge for any character (regardless of Potency, as it is a special attribute).</p>

<p><strong>Potency</strong> When a character's powers increase they may get a special attribute called <em>Potency</em>. A character's Potency is added to the <em>maximum</em> (but not necessarily the actual value) of each of their Physical, Mental, and Social attributes, and every point of Potency increases their maximum Magic Points by 3. Normal humans have a Potency of zero. Some spawn and other weak supernatural creatures (such as Mirror Goblins) have a Potency of one. Starting supernatural creatures of a playable type such as Vampires or Witches have a Potency of 2. This rating gradually rises as the creature ages and grows in eldritch power, and can rise quite abruptly by slaying powerful elders <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091203/">Highlander</a> style, or by attuning to powerful artifacts, completing mighty rituals of vast power, or otherwise reaching the kinds of breakpoints in a story in which a monster might become nearly unstoppable. Supernatural monsters that have
attained power beyond that possible in a human lifetime are known as Elders and have a Potency of 3 or higher. The most powerful named characters in the setting (such as The King with Three Shadows or Echidna) have a Potency of 10, and player characters can expect to have a Potency much, much lower than that.</p>
<p>Potency limits the Powers that a character has access to. With potency 1 character has access to only Basic Powers. A Potency of 2 or higher grants access to Advanced powers. With a potency of 3 or more comes access to Elder powers, which would otherwise be limited to great and terrible ritual or myth. Most characters are limited to no more than one Elder power per additional point of Potency.</p>
<p>Such power has its price. Any character with a Potency of 1 or greater (and some that don't) are ruled by a Master Passion, an emotional flaw that subjects them to uncontrollable frenzy. Each additional point of Potency deepens this price by requiring a Disadvantage, starting with the Distinctive Flaw of their particular type, and from there usually developing in related but individualistic ways.</p>
<p><em>Genevra is a Vampire with Potency 2. This means that her <strong>maximum</strong> value for raising her Agility, Willpower, and other attributes is 11. 9 maximum for having started as a human, plus her Potency of 2. Her maximum Power Reserve is 13 (7 + 3*2).</em></p>

<h3 id="fluid-traits"><a class="header" href="#fluid-traits">Fluid Traits</a></h3>
<p>Rather than fixed (or at least rarely changing) ratings of a character's core competencies, Fluid Traits change frequently as they are spent or damaged and then (hopefully) recovered over the course of events in a game.</p>
<p><strong>Vitality</strong> is a measure of the character's physical capacity for damage. When a character is wounded or otherwise experiences physical trauma they mark off boxes of Vitality to represent their fading ability to cling to life (or whatever pale imitation of life they may cling to). A character's maximum Vitality is always 10. When a character has no more Vitality they will shortly be dead. Wounding and healing is covered in more detail in the Wounds, Death, and Dying section of the Danger chapter.</p>
<p><strong>Stress</strong> is a measure of the character's accumulated mental strain. When a character is subjected to traumatic or triggering experiences they accumulate points of Stress to represent their fading grip on mental and emotional stability. Stress adds to the threshold for resisting Frenzy and other breaking points. There is no maximum to Stress, but when it exceeds a character's Willpower they can no longer keep their cool and automatically succumb either to the panic condition (in the case of mortals) or go into Frenzy or Despondency (in the case of Monsters), in either case explosively burning off some of their Stress.</p>
<p><strong>Luck</strong> is a measure of the fluid benefit Edge provides until it runs out. A character's maximum Luck is equal to their Edge. You can spend it in a few ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can reroll all the dice on a test that didn't get a hit.</li>
<li>You can add a number of extra dice to a test equal to your Edge score. If penalties would reduce your normal dice pool to zero or less then you can spend an Edge to try anyway with dice equal to your Edge score.</li>
<li>You can use the Dodge or Dive For Cover actions to try to avoid an attack or other danger without using your action, or after you've already acted in a round.</li>
<li>You can stabilize while dying.</li>
<li>You can survive an otherwise lethal situation in a narratively appropriate way. At this point, you are having fate intervene to save you in a narratively plausible fashion. This will require negotiation with the MC to determine what is plausible under the circumstances, but it's more sometimes better than the previous option because it explicitly avoids someone killing you while you are incapacitated by wounds. Maybe it's the police showing up before the Trolls have the opportunity to put the boot in, maybe it's the floor collapsing and dumping your comatose character into the basement before the flames have an opportunity to burn them to death. A character being saved in such a manner will be inconvenienced in some fashion, possibly a great deal. It's intended as a last-ditch save-your-ass moment, not something to be smugly relied upon.</li>
</ul>
<p>Luck refreshes between Chapters or when you make progress on a Driving Goal. You do not have to spend Luck to get the bonus dice that Edge provides when soaking a stab wound or resisting mental domination - the extra Edge dice for Resistance Tests are automatic and free - but you can spend it to get even more dice on a Resistance Test.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4 id="luck-for-antagonists"><a class="header" href="#luck-for-antagonists">Luck for Antagonists</a></h4>
<p>There's an inherent imbalance in the way players continuously play their own characters and the way that the MC plays antagonists. The player's characters will keep being played after the current conflict, while antagonists often pass on and off the stage after a single scene. It's tempting to have Luminary antagonists burn their entire luck in that one scene while a player would hold back a reserve point or two for truly desperate circumstances that may come later. It's recommended that the MC thus only use at most one Luck per scene, unless spending it for last-ditch survival, to better portray the way that Luck is usually spent. At least, that is, until the final climatic moments of a story where all bets are off and everyone pours everything they have into the action with little or nothing held back for their own survival.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Power Reserve</strong> is a measure of the character's ability to exert themselves magically. A character's Power Reserve is measured in <em>Magic Points</em>, or <strong>MP</strong> for short, which are generally spent to activate specific supernatural abilities that a character might have. A character's Power Reserve does not automatically refresh. Characters that are supernatural creatures will not only have things to do with their Magic Points, but will also have a particular way to refresh them called their <em>Power Schedule</em>. Characters have a <strong>maximum</strong> at any given time of 7 MP plus 3 MP per point of Potency. This means that most player characters (who have a Potency of 2) will have their Power Reserve fill up at 13. Mortals and other Potency 0 creatures have a nominal Magic Point maximum of 7, but likely have no ability or reason to acquire Magic Points.</p>
<p><em>Example: Genevra is a Vampire with the Quickness ability from the Power of Celerity. As a vampire, she has the Vigor ability from the Clout discipline, and can spend Magic Points to increase her Strength for a scene. Because she is a vampire, she can refresh her Magic Points by drinking blood from other people.</em></p>
<p>There is one generic way Magic Points can be spent: you can spend Magic Points up to your Potency to add dice to any Resistance Roll against a supernatural power on a one-for-one basis.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4 id="optional-rule-burn"><a class="header" href="#optional-rule-burn">Optional Rule: Burn</a></h4>
<p>Fate and Magic Points give characters a lot of , but they are precious resources that can be used up very quickly. With this optional rule, characters can Burn permanent attributes to refresh their fluid traits, either Edge to refill luck or Potency to refill Magic Points. Characters do not naturally recover from Burn; they'll have to get those points back through Karmic Advancement or Magical Transformation. Burn is intended to allow characters to have very dramatic, powerful successes when making a long-term mechanical sacrifice is worth it for the story, but Burn is inherently unbalanced in the short term compared to the rest of After Sundown's implied metagame balance.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="using-attributes-without-skills"><a class="header" href="#using-attributes-without-skills">Using Attributes Without Skills</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;Granted, but I'm still huge.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Characters in After Sundown may be called upon to use skills when they don't actually have training in that area. In this case, the character is called upon to <em>default</em> on the skill. This allows the character to roll a dicepool of their appropriate Attribute (plus zero dice for not having the skill). When defaulting on a Social or Technical Skill, the character suffers an additional -1 die  penalty for being untrained. When using Technical Skills, that same -1 die penalty applies whenever the character doesn't have an appropriate specialization (even if they <em>do</em> have the appropriate skill). In other cases, the appropriate skill might be some sort of Background, which should generally be interpreted broadly.</p>
<p>There are a few of times when you will want to do something for which <em>no</em> skill, active or background, applies. In that case a mere attribute roll may suffice (obviously with no -1 die penalty). But remember that dice pools without skills are substantially <em>smaller</em> than dicepools with skills attached - so in most cases the MC should try to figure out a way to fit a skill in. Resistance Tests are a special case of this, since Luminaries get to add their Edge to the roll instead of a skill, and Extras are meant to be easy to affect.</p>
<h4 id="sure-things-heavy-lifting"><a class="header" href="#sure-things-heavy-lifting">Sure Things: Heavy Lifting</a></h4>
<p><em>&quot;Sure, sometimes you can do all kinds of stuff. But I can <strong>always</strong> lift a car.&quot;</em></p>
<p>There are things you don't have to roll because they simply <em>are</em>. A character with a high Charisma <em>is</em> charming, a character with a high Logic <em>is</em> smart. Even if they offend someone or fail to solve a problem, they will do so in a charming or intelligent fashion. But probably the thing you will run into most frequently as far as automatic uses of Attributes is Strength. People who have a high Strength <em>are strong</em>, and they can lift heavy things. So to help out with that, here's a table of how much a character might be able to push themselves to lift, and how much they might be able to carry home without hurting themselves.</p>

<p>And yes, things that are really strong are <em>very strong</em>. A creature with a strength of 35 can lift a <em>train</em> right off the track. Although they can only do this by lifting one car at a time and can't really walk off with it. Consider the scene in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0024216/">King Kong</a> where the giant ape (who in After Sundown would be a Kaiju) pulls a train off the tracks by lifting a car and dropping the whole thing. That's not an exaggeration, in After Sundown the giant apes can actually do those things.</p>
<h2 id="skills"><a class="header" href="#skills">Skills</a></h2>
<p><em>&quot;No one may ever know if what you did was good or bad, but you did it well.&quot;</em></p>
<p>A key portion of the die roll for any test is the <em>skill</em>. It represents <em>specific</em> training that helps a character perform a task. And because of that, it can lead to a fair amount of confusion among some people, because linguistically we refer both to people who are very good at something and also people who are good at a wide variety of things as being &quot;skilled&quot;. In After Sundown, skills are confined to the former interpretation. Jacks of All Trades are represented game mechanically by people who have relatively high <em>attributes</em> and low skills. People with high skills are specialists by definition.</p>
<h3 id="specializations"><a class="header" href="#specializations">Specializations</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;This is what I'm good at. And I'm the best. You might ask: 'what good is that'? And the answer is that being the best at anything makes you the best at something.&quot;</em></p>
<p>A specialization is a subset of a skill that a character is especially proficient in. When they make tests using the skill in a manner that is relevant to their interests, they gain 2 extra dice in their dice pool. Technical skills are an inherently specialized field, so in addition to getting 2 extra dice within a character's specialties, Technical Skill dicepools are <em>penalized</em> by 1 die if they are being used outside a relevant specialization.</p>
<p>The sample specializations are by no means comprehensive, and players should work out with their MC to find or create specializations that are right for them. A character might have their Sabotage specialized in Eco-Terrorism covering both spiking trees (that might more frequently go under &quot;traps&quot;) <em>and</em> breaking a bulldozer (that might more frequently go under &quot;Disabling Stuff&quot;). Another character might have their Animal Ken specialized in Horses, covering the training, breeding, and calming of wild and domestic horses. </p>
<p>The MC should take care to make sure that no specialization is universally useful. Specializing a skill in something that would apply in all cases is basically the same as just getting 2 points in the skill, and that's unfair. MCs must be expected to reject specializing Combat in &quot;fighting&quot; or specializing Bureaucracy in &quot;paperwork.&quot; A character can have more than one specialization in the same skill, and this is often very important for Technical skills. If more than one Specialization would apply, the character still only gets 2 bonus dice.</p>
<h2 id="physical-skills"><a class="header" href="#physical-skills">Physical Skills</a></h2>
<p>Physical skills involve doing stuff with your body. Since everyone has a body, the defaulting penalty for using physical skills untrained is zero. Without specialized training you can always still make a raw attribute test. A very strong person can grapple fairly effectively on that basis alone, an intuitive person can easily notice things, and so on and so forth.</p>
<h3 id="athletics"><a class="header" href="#athletics">Athletics</a></h3>
<p>Athletics is the skill you use to run, jump, climb, swim, throw things, and generally do everything that you're vaguely expected to do in PE except sneak into the girl's locker room and get shamed by your peers. Most stunts are athletics based, and it can even be useful in attacking enemies in combat by dint of throwing things at specific targets.</p>
<p><strong>Specializations:</strong> Climb, Jump, Run, Swim, Throwing</p>
<h3 id="combat"><a class="header" href="#combat">Combat</a></h3>
<p>Combat is the training needed to fight. Usually other people. More than any other skill, people will ask to divide up Combat into smaller fragments. It is not immediately clear why, but we strongly suggest that you do not do this. While there are truly a vast array of differences between stabbing someone with a sword and shooting them with a gun - the simple fact that the combat simulationist player can <em>name</em> them all draws attention to how simply not that different they are. The basic truths of the Combat skill include making rapid life and death decisions while avoiding threats and putting the pointy end of your weapon into the other man. There's a world of differences in possible combat situations, and that's why the skill goes all the way to six. But please remember that this is a game where flying a plane and managing a nuclear power plant can be the same skill (Operations).</p>
<p><strong>Specializations:</strong> By weapon or martial style.</p>
<h3 id="drive"><a class="header" href="#drive">Drive</a></h3>
<p>Drive allows people to drive culturally appropriate vehicles. For people in the west, that's mostly just cars. But for people in river areas or fishing communities, that's often small boats as well. Driving under safe conditions is such a banal and non-awesome thing, that characters do not need to actually make rolls to do it, so players may not even need the skill. But when it comes to dangerous driving conditions, car chases, or even just cutting commute times, rolls are generally required, and having the skill is helpful. This dichotomy is generally why in movies cars wipe out spectacularly the moment someone uses magic to create icy road conditions - a lot of people on the road are legitimately terrible drivers, and the moment things get harsh they become one of the 18,000 car accidents that happen every day in the US. </p>
<p>A character can drive a new non-standard type of vehicle for every rating point and specialization of the skill they have. Common choices are emergency vehicles, motor boats, construction equipment, armored vehicles, light aircraft, and oversized (semis and buses), but really players can pretty much go nuts. Any plane or ship which is piloted with dials and knobs rather than a wheel or stick is the domain of Operations rather than Drive.</p>
<p><strong>Specializations:</strong> Bad Weather, Aggressive Driving, Cross Town Traffic, Navigation</p>
<h3 id="larceny"><a class="header" href="#larceny">Larceny</a></h3>
<p>Characters skilled at Larceny are adept at working outside the law. It is a broad skill that covers lots of dubious activities, from identifying and bypassing security systems to picking other peoples' pockets. There is some overlap between Larceny and Rigging when dealing with locks. Locks are both geared puzzles and a basic hindrance to breaking into places. This is a good skill to have for security workers in addition to criminals. You gotta know your enemy if you're gonna win the war. </p>
<p><strong>Specializations:</strong> Concealing Goods, Legerdemain, Lockpicking, Security Systems</p>
<h3 id="perception"><a class="header" href="#perception">Perception</a></h3>
<p>Perception is the skill by which a character perceives the world around themselves. It is used to spot clues, notice subtle noises, and smell unfortunate smells. Characters with very low Perceptions are the characters who do not notice monsters sneaking up on them or have to have the meaning or import of subtle clues explained to them by other protagonists.</p>
<p><strong>Specializations:</strong> By sense, Investigation, Noticing sneaking</p>
<h3 id="stealth"><a class="header" href="#stealth">Stealth</a></h3>
<p>The Stealth skill is what one uses to avoid being noticed, either by moving quietly, becoming unseen against the background, or simply blending into the crowd. Whenever a character is being searched for, a Stealth check can be used to make that searching more difficult. Stealth involves using what is available, so there is almost no circumstance in which it cannot be used to at least postpone the moment that a character is noticed.</p>
<p><strong>Specializations:</strong> Hiding, Innocuity, Shadowing, Sneaking</p>
<h3 id="survival"><a class="header" href="#survival">Survival</a></h3>
<p>100% of the creatures alive today are the descendants of an unbroken line of ancestors who were all able to survive in their environment long enough to have had children that extends back to when single celled organisms had only two different nucleotides in their DNA. So persisting in the face of adversity is something that creatures have a birthright to. And yet, adversity has also kept up with the times. Survival is the skill of keeping up with the elements.</p>
<p>One can also make Survival checks to scavenge things of a more modern nature. A Survival check could be called for to loot useful things out of a junk yard or to track the layout of a sewer system.</p>
<p><strong>Specializations:</strong> Tracking, Gathering, Shelter, by Environment.</p>
<h2 id="social-skills"><a class="header" href="#social-skills">Social Skills</a></h2>
<p>Regular socialization is performed with Backgrounds, rather than social skills. If you want to ingratiate yourself with others, track down the word on the street, or otherwise perform social legwork, you probably want to use a background like <em>High Society</em> or <em>Barrio</em>. Social skills apply a -1 penalty to the dicepool when defaulting.</p>
<h3 id="animal-ken"><a class="header" href="#animal-ken">Animal Ken</a></h3>
<p>Dealing with inhuman beasts is a skill in and of itself. Neither lions nor sheep really have any backgrounds, and the Animal Ken skill is used in their place. Animal Ken is used to read the emotions of an animal as well as to calm one down or train it to do stuff. Animal Ken is thus your one-stop-shop for all socialization with dogs, which considering how much less a dog knows than any human or supernatural about important plot points, is not nearly as overpowered as you might think</p>
<p><strong>Specializations:</strong> Domestic Animals, Training, Wild Animals, Riding.</p>
<h3 id="bureaucracy"><a class="header" href="#bureaucracy">Bureaucracy</a></h3>
<p>Managing logistics and patiently untangling skeins of red tape is the focus of this skill. Characters can understand and manipulate laws, navigate management systems, and correctly formulate formal requests. Bureaucracy is of use whether the character is attempting to perform bureaucratic tasks and of equal utility when confronted by the implacable edifice of a Kafkaesque course. It is not unusual for people to resent bureaucracy, because it is annoying. But as anyone who has done logistics under any circumstances can tell you, <em>not</em> having rules, management, and records in place is <em>even worse</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Specializations:</strong> Business, Government, Logistics</p>
<h3 id="empathy"><a class="header" href="#empathy">Empathy</a></h3>
<p>Empathy is our primary means of interpreting the meaning of actions and inactions of other people. It is a trainable sense of how others are feeling given how they look, what they say, and what they do. Empathy is of obvious use to people like lawyers and police, but it is also an important skill for batters in baseball. It is not merely about figuring out whether someone is being truthful when they are talking, but also about determining what someone is about to do in the physical world.</p>
<p><strong>Specializations:</strong> Motivation Determination, Detecting Lies, Action Anticipation</p>
<h3 id="expression"><a class="header" href="#expression">Expression</a></h3>
<p>Expression is the art of entertaining and changing peoples' minds through art. Lots of people think that this can only be accomplished by making movies about gay cowboys eating pudding, but the truth is that <em>any</em> art that provokes the audience to even acknowledge it is on some level influencing the audience. Expression overlaps with Artisan to a significant extent; in general, anything that can be expressed with words falls under Expression, while anything that creates or shapes an object is Artisan.</p>
<p><strong>Specializations:</strong> Writing, Dance, Music, Oratory</p>
<h3 id="intimidation"><a class="header" href="#intimidation">Intimidation</a></h3>
<p>Intimidation is the art of using fear to get other people to believe or do things desired of them. Intimidation can be explicit (&quot;If you don't do X, I will stab you. In the face.&quot;) or implied (&quot;Did you hear that the feds caught Ted for his tax non-payment? He's going to be doing <em>time</em>.&quot;) and the threats can be to the target's person, finances, or reputation. And some of the best Intimidation is phrased in a manner that implies that some third party will do something to the target and the Intimidating character is willing to help <em>the target</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Specializations:</strong> Interrogation, Fear Mongering, Skulduggery, Blackmail</p>
<h3 id="persuasion"><a class="header" href="#persuasion">Persuasion</a></h3>
<p>Persuasion is the art of manipulating people in such a manner that it isn't immediately obvious that is what you're doing. People who are skilled at Persuasion are essentially good at <em>lying</em>, although many of them get offended if you call it that. They may prefer the term <em>acting</em> or <em>sales</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Specializations:</strong> Acting, Insinuation, Fast Talk</p>
<h3 id="tactics"><a class="header" href="#tactics">Tactics</a></h3>
<p>Tactics is the skill that governs leadership in both the military and corporate sense of the term. Characters can inspire others to give 100% or produce a battle plan. The dragon crawls on its belly, and Tactics dovetails closely with Bureaucracy in the plotting of war, whether genuine or metaphorical. The tactical aspect involves maneuvering and the orders necessary to get others to do that - in contrast to the simple appeals to rules or potentially complex logistical management of Bureaucracy.</p>
<p><strong>Specializations:</strong> Inspiration, Maneuvers, Naval, Siege</p>
<h2 id="technical-skills"><a class="header" href="#technical-skills">Technical Skills</a></h2>
<p>Technical skills apply the -1 penalty for defaulting if a character doesn't have an appropriate specialization. That is, a character may have Artisan (Painting), but they will still have to default when welding. A character who becomes trained in any Technical skill gains a specialization in that skill for free. A character can't have a specialization in a skill they don't have any ranks in.</p>
<h3 id="artisan"><a class="header" href="#artisan">Artisan</a></h3>
<p>The Artisan skill is used when you want to produce a physical object of some level of workmanship, whether you’re going for aesthetic quality or simple utility. There are a few more specializations in Artisan than in most Technical skills, in no small part because there are many materials that involve wildly different skills. It is recommended that these specializations are taken as applying to Artisan uses that are &quot;close enough&quot; - so a calligrapher might use the Painting specialization since in both cases they’re applying pigments to surfaces. Expression overlaps with Artisan to a significant extent; in general, anything that can be expressed with words falls under Expression, while anything that creates or shapes an object is Artisan</p>
<p><strong>Specializations:</strong> By Medium (Painting, Sculpture, Metalwork, Carpentry, Gunsmithing, etc.)</p>
<h3 id="electronics"><a class="header" href="#electronics">Electronics</a></h3>
<p>Electronics is the skill used to make the tools of modernity go. Everything from toasters to computers uses electronics to function. And a character with the Electronics <em>skill</em> can figure out how it functions and alter it. Digital computation has largely absorbed the mathematical skills that were required of learned people since antiquity; certain Elders have found a surprising knack for it.</p>
<p><strong>Specializations:</strong> Wiring, Software, Repair, Hacking, Cryptography</p>
<h3 id="medicine"><a class="header" href="#medicine">Medicine</a></h3>
<p>Medicine is the art of treating injury and illness to promote good health. Characters use this skill to patch injuries in their pets and team mates. It's also applicable to performing psychiatric first aid and figuring out psychological issues. Remember that the realm of horror runs on movie biology, meaning that characters who receive proper medical care are able to make impressive and full recoveries from amazing injuries.</p>
<p><strong>Specializations:</strong> Veterinary, First Aid, Surgery, Long Term Care, Psychiatric</p>
<h3 id="operations"><a class="header" href="#operations">Operations</a></h3>
<p>Operations is the skill of carrying out procedures correctly. It keeps the factory line running smoothly and processes the DNA correctly in the crime lab. It's the science of looking up exactly what to do and <em>actually</em> doing that. Generally, the key feature of Operations is that there isn't a direct one-to-one correspondence between what you're physically doing and what outcome occurs. Drive can steer a speedboat or fly a biplane, Operations can run a jumbo jet or a submarine. </p>
<p><strong>Specializations:</strong> Heavy Machinery, Evidence Processing, Lab Work, By Vehicle</p>
<h3 id="research"><a class="header" href="#research">Research</a></h3>
<p>Knowing things is important, but the fact is that your brain probably can't hold all the information you might want to have available - and doesn't always keep the things you do know readily accessible. When you need information that you don't have in your head, you can use the Research skill to go look it up.</p>
<p>Researching things overall is fairly uniform, but there are particular methods of looking things up that might not be obvious to people who don't use that system in particular. Specialization in Archives indicates an ability to look up information in data logs, newspaper histories, and other chronological information stores. The Library specialization involves looking up information in stores classified by content, and data mining covers sifting through Internet searches, wikis, and highly disorganized information for something useful.</p>
<p><strong>Specializations:</strong> Archives, Library, Data Mining, Interrogation</p>
<h3 id="rigging"><a class="header" href="#rigging">Rigging</a></h3>
<p>Rigging is the skill of MacGyvering and Rube-Goldberging things. It is the skill of practical and impromptu engineering. Including lockpicking, plumbing, and clockwork. Rigging is used for most non-electric jury-rigging as well as the creation, operation, and repair of most steampunk technologies, not to mention explosives and booby traps.</p>
<p><strong>Specializations:</strong> Fluids, Gears, Ropes and Pulleys, Explosives, Sabotage, Traps</p>
<h3 id="sabotage"><a class="header" href="#sabotage">Sabotage</a></h3>
<p>Sabotage is the art of breaking stuff in a manner which will be most effective. Sabotage can be used for &quot;rigging things to explode&quot; rather than the actual Rigging skill. Sabotage can be used to break things in such a way as to make them look not broken, to not break things in such a manner as they do look broken, and to make things break in such a manner as to explode. Remember that events in After Sundown have a pyrotechnics budget, so things tend to explode big.</p>
<p><strong>Specializations:</strong> Explosives, Disabling Stuff, Structural Weaknesses, Traps</p>
<h2 id="backgrounds"><a class="header" href="#backgrounds">Backgrounds</a></h2>
<p><em>You need to have knowledge to get knowledge.</em></p>
<p>A character's background skills can be literally anything. They represent areas of the game that a character can potentially do legwork in. That is to say that during a chronicle a character may find a clue (such as a strange shape on a video feed from outside a crime scene, a discarded heroin needle, or a tuft of fur), and background skills are methods a character could have to research that clue and gain more information. Background skills are ways for the players to transform story seeds into additional exposition.</p>
<p>Characters can personally know <em>any</em> isolated fact or individual person within the context of the story without there needing to be a notation on the character sheet or die roll involved. You don't need to have a background in evolutionary biology to know that humans are closest related to chimps of all the other great apes - you just need to be told that fact directly or indirectly by someone who <em>does</em> have such a background. But to actually evaluate the research, you need to understand the power and limitations of the methods and the kinds of results that have also been achieved.</p>
<p>Backgrounds are divided into how one interacts with them. <strong>Academic</strong> Backgrounds are ones in which the character can &quot;go look something up.&quot; They often dovetail nicely with the Research, Perception, or Bureaucracy skills. Sciences, ancient languages, classical art, and so forth make good Academic Backgrounds. <strong>Social</strong> Backgrounds are ones where the character &quot;goes to talk to some people.&quot; They often dovetail nicely with Social skills like Empathy or Persuasion. Any social group can and does represent a potential Social Background. <strong>Occult</strong> Backgrounds are ones that involve the character &quot;going to do something in secret.&quot; What skills are helpful for this kind of legwork are highly variable, because Occult Backgrounds are a very variable category. Many Occult Backgrounds are sometimes literally magical in origin (such as <em>Marduk Society Histories</em> or <em>Tarot Readings</em>), while others are simply secret for a variety of other reasons (legality, morality, or whatever). The defining point of Occult Backgrounds is that telling other people that you have them jeopardizes your ability to use them. The first rule about ghost cartels is the same as the first rule about fight club.</p>
<p>It is frequently important for purposes of socialization whether or not characters have &quot;the same&quot; background or not. Characters who have the same Background automatically have shared interests that they can talk about. However, game mechanically, Backgrounds <em>do not</em> have to have the same name to be &quot;the same.&quot; And two Backgrounds that are &quot;the same&quot; in one instance may be &quot;different&quot; in another. A Background is &quot;the same&quot; if in the current instance it covers essentially the same stuff. If one character had <em>Triads</em> and another character had <em>San Francisco Crime</em> as a Background, the two characters would be on wholly common ground when discussing San Francisco's triad operations, and would be speaking Greek or Martian to each other if the conversation changed to Hong Kong triads or San Francisco's IRA network.</p>
<p>It is up to the MC to determine what constitutes an acceptable Background for the campaign. In general, however, it is better to err on the side of Backgrounds that are too useful than ones that are too narrow. While it <em>is</em> overpowered for a character to have a Background that applies in virtually (or actually) all circumstances like &quot;Stuff&quot; or &quot;Trivia&quot;, the worst thing that's going to happen under such a circumstance is that the player is going to roleplay a lot and move the plot forward. That's not fair to the other characters (unless they are doing the same), but that's still better than the players feeling powerless and having the story stagnate.</p>
<h3 id="languages"><a class="header" href="#languages">Languages</a></h3>
<p>Languages work much like Backgrounds and can be used just like them in many cases; if you know French you can at least practice with someone else that knows French, and at higher levels you've probably read some of the same authors, watched the same shows, or listened to the same speeches, because those are the things that are used to learn languages. A single point in a language is enough to generally get by with a dictionary, the level possessed by a skilled traveler or an academic working through scholarly articles. Two points is broad fluency, and three is near-native level. A rating of 4 or more represents not only fluid proficiency but broad general exposure to the spoken and literary culture of a language.</p>
<p>Effectively, the character's effective rating in other Social skills and Backgrounds is limited by the language they converse or write in: they have all of the eloquence imparted by their Persuasion and Backgrounds with their native language, and otherwise their effective rating is limited to <em>twice</em> their rating in the language they are using, so 3 points is generally enough unless you're pushing the human limits of a skill.</p>
<p>Language Backgrounds allow the character to know that language personally. A character does not specifically need to know a language to get something translated. The ability to conjure up simple phrases such as &quot;¿Donde está el baño?&quot; or &quot;Lehněte a svlekněte se prosím.&quot; is free. Some time with an automated translation can get you a humorously inaccurate translation of many pieces of text (especially short text). And given some time, many Contacts or Intelligence Resources can translate specific languages on your behalf.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that all four major Syndicates date from before the ascent of English as the world language and knowing their prefered argot is handy. The Covenant is thoroughly wed to Ecclesiastical Latin, the World Crime League operates diplomatically in Vietnamese but also variously employs Cantonese, Mandarin, and Malay, and in their traditional homes the Makhzen tend to have a passionate commitment to languages that have been dead to the rest of the world for 2,000 years but favor Arabic for diplomacy. Even the Communes have a loyalty to French that newly created monsters find somewhat surprising.</p>
<h3 id="sample-backgrounds"><a class="header" href="#sample-backgrounds">Sample Backgrounds</a></h3>
<p><em>Trust me, I've seen stuff like this before.</em></p>
<p>The completely open-ended nature of Backgrounds can be paralyzing when it comes to actual character creation. A blank page can be filled up with <em>anything</em>, but frequently it isn't. So to help with that, here are some examples of backgrounds that some of the characters from the Persona Non Grata chapter have and some descriptions of things they use them for in their chronicles.</p>
<h3 id="social-backgrounds"><a class="header" href="#social-backgrounds">Social Backgrounds</a></h3>
<p>Support Groups: Harley did not have an easy childhood and that lead to a messy young adulthood and a lot of legally mandated treatment represented by the Support Groups Background. After hearing kids talking about an addict missing from their neighborhood, Harley's player thinks to go find the nearest church basement and check in with the group leaders to see if they know the person. After taking some time to figure out what groups the person attended (Intuition + Support Groups) she gets them to open up and break anonymity to give her some leads. When she needs a place to lay low for a while or just find new friends in a city she heads there to chat people up with Friendly Banter (Charisma + Support Groups).</p>
<p>Truckin': Jack spends a lot of time on the road and on the radio talkin' to other truckers, and this is represented by his Truckin Background. This means that he has an encyclopedic knowledge of rest stops all up and down the 101. So when he gets a time frame for when the van presumably lightened its load, he can make a very accurate guess (Logic + Truckin) about where to start looking for the bodies. When he is listening to someone's description of their journey to Walnut Creek, he notices (Intuition + Truckin) a discrepancy in their story.</p>
<p>Bar Scene: Dean goes out drinking frequently to attempt to forget the hole in his soul, and this justifies his Bar Scene Background. The team needs a decoy, so Dean goes off to the roadhouse to go pick up an extra woman for that purpose (Willpower + Bar Scene). Later on, they need to track down a fishy poker game, so he asks around (Charisma + Bar Scene).</p>
<p>Kink Scene: Mr. Eaten's main social outings are to kink events, where he can easily go by an alias and cameras are carefully limited. When looking for appropriate prey he watches how people react to scenes (Intuition + Kink Scene) to see if they might be amenable to his tastes. When moving in to converse with a likely candidate (Charisma + Kink Scene) his understanding of the customs and protocols of the scene make things go smoothly.</p>
<h3 id="academic-backgrounds"><a class="header" href="#academic-backgrounds">Academic Backgrounds</a></h3>
<p>Psychiatry: Harley was an accomplished psychiatrist before her transformation, and thus it is reasonable for her to have the Psychiatry background. After interviewing a man that witnessed a Poltergeist attack she needs to throw the police off the trail. So Marionette throws out a plausible-sounding Psychiatric explanation for the cops to eat up and spread as rumor (Willpower + Psychiatry). Later when she's trying to understand the trauma of a Wraith her (Intuition + Empathy) test has a very low Threshold.</p>
<p>Cars and Trucks: Jack knows all about things on the roads. So when it comes time to research up the DMV registration on the kidnappers' van, Jack grabs it and gets an answer for certain, because he knows that he is looking for a 2005 Charcoal Dodge Sprinter. But later on, he reaches for something to talk to the guys at Pizza Hog about, and cars seems like as good a topic as any. And since there are some other gear heads, it works out and he uses it as a Friendly Banter (Charisma + Cars and Trucks) platform.</p>
<p>Ballistics: Dean may not seem that bright, but he does know his way around firearms, and this interest is represented by his Ballistics Background. Not only can he talk for hours to gun enthusiasts about caliber and grains, but he can perform the kind of scientific forensic investigation that a ballistics expert might be called upon for. When he picks up the supposed murder weapon, he immediately notices (Intuition + Ballistics) that something is wrong because the armor-piercing bullets in the magazine should have exit wounds on the corpse. Later he measures out the probable point of origin from the bullets and gets a fix on the shooter's location (Logic + Ballistics). And when they have the specs on the enchanted rifle and Dean wants to look up what kind of weapon they are dealing with, he just does it because his Background knowledge pushes the Research threshold down to zero.</p>
<p>Fire Investigation: since he uses fire magic Mr. Eaten has been cramming information on how arsons and other fires are investigated, although he's only picked up a little so far. After using his powers to incinerate a target he tries to clean up the scene and his basic knowledge means that he has a standard threshold to cover up evidence (Logic + Sabotage).</p>
<h3 id="occult-backgrounds"><a class="header" href="#occult-backgrounds">Occult Backgrounds</a></h3>
<p>Joker Gang: Harley spent a long time as a lieutenant to a boss that terrorized Gotham which amounts to her Joker Gang background. When she needs some explosives she calls up an old friend to get them (Charisma + Joker Gang), and when reports come in of a &quot;vault heist&quot; come in she can go through the details and identify it as a feint (Logic + Joker Gang) because she knows how to break into a vault and what people are looking for in them.</p>
<p>Chinese Monsters: Jack has put up with a lot of bullshit from the Eastern wing of the Shattered Empire, and he knows his long-haired ghosts from his thundering witches. During the investigations, he meets up with The Peach Lady, and needing something to talk about, he reaches for supernatural stuff from her homeland. This is an acceptable form of Friendly Banter (Charisma + Chinese Monsters), and seemingly gets the immortal beauty to open up to him. Later on, he comes face to face with an Asian Leviathan and identifies it as such (Logic + Chinese Monsters).</p>
<p>Hell Mouths: Dean has been in and out of the Dark Reflection many times, and this is reflected in his Hell Mouths Background. As they are searching the house, Dean notices (Intuition + Hell Mouths) that the bathroom mirror has been used as a portal, and fairly recently by the ashen smell. When the team finds itself outside the Iron Tower, Dean falls on his knowledge of hellmouth locations to plan a route back to the mortal world (Logic + Hell Mouths).</p>
<p>Midwest Communes Operations: Mr. Eaten has aspirations to the Vanguard and hops on clean-up jobs with thorough professionalism. When a portal reopens outside Omaha he matches the rumors coming out to previous incursions (Intuition + Midwest Communes Operations). Later he manages to get himself invited onto the team heading out to deal with the matter by mentioning his familiarity to the Citizen organizing the mission (Charisma + Midwest Communes Operations).</p>
<h3 id="language-backgrounds"><a class="header" href="#language-backgrounds">Language Backgrounds</a></h3>
<p>Latin: it's been a while, but between Catholic school and med school Harley has a pretty decent grasp of Latin. She can make her way through the mad occult ramblings of a sorcerer she's investigating (Logic + Research) with a low threshold so long as she has a dictionary handy.</p>
<p>Cantonese: Jack's pronunciation is awful, but he's picked up a lot of street-level Chinese. He has no trouble noticing that he's getting ripped off at the gambling tables (Intuition + Empathy) by the Cantonese-speaking gamblers, but later has a bit of difficulty following the archaic dialect of the Leviathan that seems to be intent on making a meal of him (Logic + Cantonese).</p>
<p>Enochian: Dean doesn't have much of an academic background, but he's smart and had to spend a lot of time dealing with Enochian inscriptions used by the things that harass him. When coming across one of their messages he's able to puzzle it out and make some critical adjustments to his benefit (Logic + Enochian).</p>
<p>Latin: Mr. Eaten is the proud and paranoid owner of one of the few remaining copies of the <em>Umbrarum Regni Novem Portis</em>, which is printed in late Medieval Latin. He's not great, but he's supplementing high school Latin with a dog-eared dictionary and some time on Duolingo and slowly making his way through the precious grimoire. He knows just enough that he can reference his single text (Logic + Research) with no penalty to the threshold. When eavesdropping on some Covenant diplomats he manages to get the gist of their discussion with (Intuition + Latin).</p>
