<p>Let us look back to 1990. The moral panic over Satanic ritual abuse was in full swing. Vampires were cool and the Interview movie was still in development hell. The Golden Age of Slasher Movies had ended and we were inundated with direct-to-video horror sequels. The 2nd Edition of Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons was coming out and they cut all the cool stuff like demons and assassins in a facile attempt to get the contemptible fundies like Patricia Pulling off their backs. In reaction to this a different sort of game was produced.</p>
<p>Contrary to what some of you are thinking, it was not Vampire: The Masquerade, which was not due out for another year. It was Nightlife. And it Nightlife you weren't limited to being a vampire (... or vampyre, for... reasons) but could also be a werewolf, ghost, daemon, wyght, animate, or... Inuit. So, a lot of questionable decisions were made, and it never had the popularity of White Wolf's crowning glory, but it did have some workable and interesting ideas at its core. And we've had the benefit of another 30 years of game design since then, which is far more than they had, 1990 being only 16 years after D&amp;D's Little Brown Books first left the presses in 1974.</p>
<p>In that time a man with the improbable name Frank Trollman, who had his own commercial game credits, made his own horror heartbreaker inspired by this legacy. The original version of After Sundown was published as a series of forum posts on the Gaming Den in 2011.

<p><em>&quot;To write a story together, everyone must be on the same page.&quot;</em></p>
<p>One of the primary purposes of a cooperative storytelling game is to provide a foundation upon which stories can be told. The other is to provide a framework by which disagreements about how a story should progress can be worked out in an acceptably impartial fashion.</p>
<p>The setting of After Sundown is a world like our own would be if horror fiction had an element of truth to it. There really are monsters in the night and other worlds full of nightmarish horrors that bleed into the mortal world. But it is also set in a decidedly modern world, and that means modern sensibilities. The game's backstory sees history and mythology through a modern interpretation, and adopts horror tropes that resonate with modern audiences. Many horror tropes are timeless - blood speckled claws in the dark is pretty much always going to be scary - but many other horror elements are merely puzzling, and are going to be downplayed. The modern audience is not particularly worried about miscegenation or communist invasion, and those elements of old horror fiction are deliberately excluded from their appropriation into After Sundown.</p>

<p><em>&quot;A story is finite in length. To have anything in it, an infinite number of things must be excluded.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Ask a dozen people to describe vampires or witches, and you'll get a dozen different answers. And that is a tremendous problem for cooperative storytelling because everyone is supposedly trying to add to the same story. Stories told in After Sundown may have vampires in them, but these are <em>not</em> the vampires written about by Stoker or Rice, they are the vampires in the stories told by <em>your gaming group</em> set in the realm of horror described in this book. These vampires have an aesthetic that is informed by horror movies, comic books, and both punk and goth subcultures, but they are necessarily different from the monsters described in any particular other work of fiction, and they absolutely do not sparkle.</p>
<p>It is important to note that you can't take everything from myth and legend and cram it into a story. That's not to say that your story will be completely incoherent, although of course it will be. It's just that the scope is beyond human comprehension. <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/607090.The_Vampire_Book">The Vampire Book</a> is an encyclopedia of just vampire lore from various cultures and it is literally over nine hundred pages long. And we're not talking about character backgrounds or rules text or any other game material that eats up word count; just a bare list of facts by mythical origin. It is still nine hundred pages, and while it is quite comprehensive, there are still vampire facts it does not contain. So it is imperative not only that you acknowledge that you're going to have to cut things down to a manageable amount, but also that you establish specifically what is off-limits and what's included before you start telling a cooperative story. It is unreasonable to expect that other people sitting down at the table with you think to the same mythic source material when you mention even something as specific as Frankenstein's Monster - the creature in the book was wicked fast but the Boris Karloff rendition was a lumbering brute.</p>
<p>So we're paring things down. A lot. We don't have, need, or even want a bajillion clans of vampires, or fifteen tribes of werewolves. There should be few enough flavors of things that all the players can remember what the differences between them are. Ideally, people should be able to play whatever supernatural guys they want, sort of like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_League_of_Extraordinary_Gentlemen">League of Extraordinary Gentlemen</a>; but in practice, you have to put explicit limitations on what is part of the story or things get all weird. Like with Martian invasions and stuff, what was up with that? A story that doesn't have specific exclusions does not truly have any specific inclusions. It's not a story at all at that point, it's a mess.</p>
<p>The base concept for After Sundown is that you are roleplaying a classic Universal Studios Monster and you engage in narrative-driven dramatic role-playing of both horror and intrigue. The Universal Horror Films were, if not documentaries, at least &quot;dramatic reenactments&quot; of real events in the shared world you will be telling stories in. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0024184/">The Invisible Man</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0034398/">The Wolfman</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0046876/">The Creature from the Black Lagoon</a>, and of course <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0021814/">Dracula</a> were all real people, and the player characters can be creatures like them. And the players in After Sundown can use monster movies old and new for inspiration. But remember that the monsters in every piece of fiction are different, and that while you are telling stories with After Sundown that it is the descriptions of monsters <em>in this book</em> that break ties. Werewolves can transform voluntarily when the moon isn't full and Vampires do not cast fire in the sun. Not because these creatures are like this in every movie, but because that is how they are in the stories told with the After Sundown cooperative storytelling game.</p>
<h2 id="things-you-need-to-play"><a class="header" href="#things-you-need-to-play">Things You Need To Play</a></h2>
<p><em>&quot;Assuming flippant things like 'food, water, and shelter' are out of the way.&quot;</em></p>
<p>After Sundown has one or more players roleplaying as protagonists in the story, and one player acting as MC. The bare minimum number of players is therefore two, and there is no specific upper limit to the number of players a game of After Sundown can accommodate. It does seem to work best with between 3 and 6 total players though.</p>
<p>During the game, every single player is going to want some method of keeping track of things. This can be done with pencil and paper, post-it notes, or electronically using laptops or PDAs. Different players prefer note-taking and result tallying in different ways, and I won't tell you what format your character has to be kept in. A character sheet has been provided in this book, so if you want to print it out and write on it as we did in the old days, that's fine. Speaking of this book: it is distributed in electronic format, and you'll probably want to reference it (or at least have the capability to reference it) during play. That means that someone will need to bring their laptop or e-reader to the game, or print it out and bring a physical copy to the game instead. You have the right to make as many printed versions of this book as you want for non-commercial purposes, so do what you feel is best.</p>
<p>The actual mechanics of the game require rolling several six-sided dice at once to resolve actions. I suggest having at least twelve at the table. But honestly, the more the merrier. The gameplay is sped up noticeably if each player has their own dice pile in front of them, and some people even like making pre-made piles of different sizes so that they don't have to count dice before rolling.</p>
<p>Further, character advancement normally uses draws from a deck of cards (either poker or tarot). Since this is character advancement, it is entirely acceptable to have the card draws happen between sessions or even the beginning of the next session. So the game is entirely playable for an entire evening even if no one brought a deck of cards. But <em>eventually</em>, you'll want a deck of cards as well. If cards are for whatever reason unavailable, remember that virtually any computer has some sort of solitaire game loaded on it, which will among other things provide an acceptable substitute for any number of card draws.</p>
<p>Since you're going to be telling cooperative stories, you'll want some way to get diagrams across to the other players. This can be done with an erasable mat, or a dry erase board, or a pad of paper in the middle of a table. But it can also be done by sketching things on a computer, provided the screen is large enough for everyone to see.</p>
<p>After Sundown can also be played over the Internet by players who each have a computer. You can roll real dice and report the results over Internet chat (text or video), or you can use various automatic dice rollers. You'll still want the same number of players, but they need not be in the same city or even country as one another.</p>
<h2 id="the-role-of-the-mc"><a class="header" href="#the-role-of-the-mc">The Role of the MC</a></h2>
<p><em>&quot;Someone has to have the last word.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Every player except the MC plays a specific character who is a protagonist in the ensemble fiction that the cooperative storytelling game generates. This allows deeper roleplaying and lends itself to the use of first-person pronouns when describing the action. However many protagonists there are, there will still be more characters that need to be written into the story, and the actions of these characters are determined by the MC. Note that I say &quot;determined&quot; rather than &quot;played&quot; by, because none of the antagonists, allies, or indifferent background characters are the literal alter ego of the MC. The MC has a very big job in telling the story, but is also the least partisan position, and so it falls to the MC to make snap judgments about what rules apply or what numbers to use for different situations. No rule system can ever be completely comprehensive (there was a comprehensive mathematical proof to that effect by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del&#x27;s_incompleteness_theorems">Gödel</a>), and when you run into a situation that the rules cannot resolve, the MC should act as an impartial arbitrator.</p>
<p>How plots for stories are generated by the actions of the protagonists and how many are generated by external events will vary from group to group, but the MC is always heavily involved. Even when the other players are producing action and dialog sufficient to drive storytelling, it still falls to the MC to determine what responses are engendered in non-player characters (NPCs) or the world around them. Playing the MC is demanding, and some groups rotate the responsibility.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="terrible-people"><a class="header" href="#terrible-people">Terrible People</a></h1>
<p><em>&quot;Have you gotten a look at the neighbors?&quot;</em></p>
<p>The realm of horror described in After Sundown is not merely the existence of nightmare worlds from which danger constantly leaks in to disrupt suburban homemaking, it also has people in it. People who are major characters and people who are the victims in slasher flicks. Sometimes, these are the same people.</p>
<h2 id="people-in-horror-extras-and-luminaries"><a class="header" href="#people-in-horror-extras-and-luminaries">People in Horror: Extras and Luminaries</a></h2>
<p><em>&quot;Do not run upstairs! There is no exit upstairs!&quot;</em></p>
<p>Remember that in horror movies there are a lot of people who serve no real purpose save to be eaten by the monsters. We call them Extras even if they happen to get some lines. These people may be strong, or smart, or beautiful, but ultimately they are doomed. If they get bitten by a zombie they will turn into one of the shambling hordes that our heroes must eventually chop through with a chain saw. They will not get cured and will not turn into leaders of the walking dead. Game mechanically, these people have no Edge score. If they turn into a supernatural creature of some kind they will become a <em>Spawn</em>. These hapless victims will not become the next Dracula, they will always be the horde vampires in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116367/">From Dusk Till Dawn</a>. They will not become Shelly Winters or Sheila, they will join the hordes of deadites and get cleaved through with fire.</p>
<p>On the other side of the coin, there <em>are</em> people in the horror genre who rise to the occasion. Whether they are introduced as badasss adventurers like Van Helsing or Rick O'Connell, or are &quot;normal people&quot; who rise to the occasion like Meg Penny or Ash, these people have a certain spark of badassery in them regardless of what they happen to be doing. They are <em>Luminaries</em>, and they have Edge. If they become Supernaturals they become the real deal. They may turn evil but they will still have lines and character development.</p>
<p>This is why characters will occasionally fight their way through a horde of zombies (who are of course <em>all</em> ex-humans) just to try to get a cure for one woman who happens to have been turned into a zombie. It isn't that they've completely lost perspective, it's that the transformation into a monster is a one way trip for absolutely everyone except a reasonably small number of luminaries. You actually can &quot;save&quot; Alice or Sheila if they get transformed into the living dead. There's literally nothing you can do for the rest of the people except shooting them in the face.</p>
<p>The exact proportion of Extras to Luminaries need not be precise so long as the former vastly outnumber the later. A few per 10,000 is a fair estimate of the number of Luminaries if one is needed. Many of these are supernatural monsters or people involved with them in some way, but some are just slightly more than ordinary people until the story intersects their lives.</p>
<h2 id="the-playable-types"><a class="header" href="#the-playable-types">The Playable Types</a></h2>
<p>The Universal Monsters have a lot of stuff in there which is not appropriate for emulation. Sure, Lon Chaney is full of awesome and I have no problem watching his movies, but neither the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0016220/">Phantom of the Opera</a> nor the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0014142/">Hunchback of Notre Dame</a> is especially supernatural. They are both just creepy guys that act monstrously. On the other end of the spectrum, the existence of space aliens harms the theme of otherworldly intrigue. So while <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047577/">This Island Earth</a> is a good movie and part of the official pantheon, the Metalunans and Zagons are not going to be part of this as visitors from space.</p>
<p>Which leaves Dracula, Frankenstein's Monster, Gillman, the Mummy, and the Wolfman - who all appear in the motion picture classic <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093560/">The Monster Squad</a>, and the Evil Wizard, the Invisible Man, and the Mole Man - who don't. It is of note however that Dracula, Frankenstein's Monster, the Wolfman, and The Invisible Man all appear in the equally mandatory movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0040068/">Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein</a>, and there is of course Evil Wizard and Mummy in the substantially less mandatory <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047795/">Abbott and Costello Meet the Mummy</a>. It seems clear that life would go on without Mole Men, but <em>what the heck?</em> We've got Mole Man in After Sundown, we call them Troglodytes.</p>
<p>Each of these broad categories of monsters varies based on the different worlds they draw their powers from, giving us Vampires from Shadow of the Vampire and Vampires from The Lost Boys that have both commonalities and differences.</p>
<h3 id="vampires"><a class="header" href="#vampires">Vampires</a></h3>
<p><em>An eternity of melancholy and betrayal is, after all, an eternity.</em></p>
<p>The Vampire is a rockstar of the living dead. They drink blood, live forever, and look great in black. Vampires are emotionally attenuated individuals who have to consume metaphorical life in the form of actual human blood. They are parasites whose very existence is a powerful metaphor for the consumptive and conflict-torn nature of the world.</p>
<p><strong>Exemplars:</strong> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0021814/">Dracula</a>. Did we mention <em>Dracula</em>? I mean sure, we can talk about the vampires from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120611/">Blade</a> or <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118276/">Buffy</a>, and we will even. But all Vampire mythos in the modern world always comes back to Dracula, because he is that awesome. And a special &quot;also-ran&quot; to the beast from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0013442/">Nosferatu</a>, because he is also awesome. <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093437">The Lost Boys</a> merits mandatory inclusion for the transformation sequences and pop-culture self-consumption.</p>
<h3 id="animates"><a class="header" href="#animates">Animates</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;Once created, a work has a life of its own.&quot;</em></p>
<p>An Animate is an artificial person. Created by unwise science, magic, or both, each Animate is a race of one. They have no peers and no possibility of children. Every Animate is created knowing that their entire people dies with them. It is a lonely and frightening existence. The Animate story is classically one that exists to explore the tragedy of dysfunctional human relationships - whether it be a child scorned by their parents, a lover scorned by the object of their affection, or simply a working person cast aside by those they worked for. The book Frankenstein explores much the same themes as a Bruce Springsteen album.</p>

<h3 id="lycanthropes"><a class="header" href="#lycanthropes">Lycanthropes</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;Even a man who is pure in heart and says his prayers by night...<br />
may become a wolf when the wolfbane blooms and the autumn moon is bright.&quot;</em></p>
<p>A Lycanthrope is someone who is cursed to transform into a rampaging beast when the moon is full or they get excited. There is plenty of mythological basis for shapeshifters who are born with the ability to turn into animals or who have attained the magic powers to do so to protect mankind, but they aren't normally figures from <em>horror</em> stories, and they aren't the Lycanthropes of After Sundown. Being a Lycanthrope means that you are a danger to people you love and the furniture around you. You can unleash the beast to rip things to pieces, but Lycanthropy is a <em>curse</em> and it is not generally very fun.</p>
<p><strong>Exemplars:</strong> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0034398/">John Talbot</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0034587/">Irena Dubrovna</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuki_Sohma">Yuki Sohma</a></p>
<h3 id="witches"><a class="header" href="#witches">Witches</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;Bubble Bubble.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Witches are people who have learned Magic. In a horror setting, magic is in almost all cases bad. The genre is pretty light on Glinda the Goods and Merlins. Magicians are generally vindictive cackling hags, satanic sorcerers, zombie-makers, mysterious strangers, and a myriad of other titles both hackneyed and terrifying. They spend a lot more time sacrificing people to gods ancient and evil and a lot less time preparing good children to go to the ball than magicians in other genres.</p>
<p>The magic that humans can use comes from three sources in After Sundown. There is the magic of Death, which is evil. There is Devil magic, which is evil. And finally, there is the twisted sorceries of Nightmares, and that's evil as well. It's not that you can't do good as a magician, you totally can. It's just that the magic itself is evil and using it is dangerous even if you are the virtuous <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0022753/">Chandu</a>. While a character may well be a voodoo death magician or an Aztec or Egyptian death magician, the magical power set is all the same. Death magic is death magic whether you call upon bones with Chinese calligraphy or African chants.</p>
<p>An important thing to realize is that The Mummy is just a Witch.  That's just how they do immortality. Sometimes it's immortality where you do evil magic and you look like a normal person (see the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0023245/">1933</a> <em>or</em> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120616/">1999</a> The Mummy) and sometimes you look like a crazy corpse in special bandages (like in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0281686/">Bubba Ho-Tep</a>). It depends. Either way, if you want to be a leftover from Egypt or Aztlan you are a Witch (or a Vampire of course). However, and this is important, the Mummies from the middle Mummy movies such as <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0037099/">The Mummy's Ghost</a> and... sigh... <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0037098/">The Mummy's Curse</a>, where the Mummy lurches around and smashes things, that Mummy is an Animate or Revenant instead. So pick a shtick and go with it.</p>

<h3 id="transhuman"><a class="header" href="#transhuman">Transhuman</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;Just a scientific experiment. To do something no other man in the world had done.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Humans do not, in general, have supernatural powers. However, in the horror genre, there are people who experience an event that changes them irrevocably into something different. Something <em>more</em>. These people generally go stark raving mad, and in not very long. The certainty that they are no longer human causes them to lose sight of human priorities, human morality. While they have become something more, they are also something <em>less</em>.</p>
<p>The transformational event can be scientific or magical. Or a bit of both. A Transhuman always has an &quot;origin story&quot; which is to some degree unique. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0024184/">The Invisible Man</a> took scientific chemicals. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0046350/">Anck Su Namun</a> simply woke up one day and realized that she is the reincarnation of an Egyptian princess. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayesha_%28novel%29">Ayesha</a> stepped into the mystical <em>flame of life</em> and stepped out an inhuman thing. Whatever the event was, it was the last thing that he or she did as a human, and the reality of that fact is as destructive to the self as the subsequent revelations of the magical world and the horrors which inhabit it.</p>

<h3 id="leviathan"><a class="header" href="#leviathan">Leviathan</a></h3>
<p><em>His face was fish-like.</em></p>
<p>Supposedly in pre-Sumerian times, there was a great mother of monsters. Her name was Tiamat. Or Vritra. It's not that important what her name was, because she was killed by a powerful human sorcerer around 4000 BCE, and most of her monstrous brood is gone as well. But not all of it. Some of them interbred with humans and hid their lineage in the darkest corners of the world. They hid from the world of men for millennia, some lurking in the darkness and plotting revenge and others merely living their own lives - the ancient conflict is long forgotten.</p>
<p>But that's not possible anymore. Things are modern, and there is nowhere to hide. Those who carry the taint of Tiamat's spawn in their ancestry or are cursed with the taint during their lives are both hunted and feared. They are destructive, and eating their flesh can make you live forever. Of course, eating their flesh makes you like them, and puts you into the same danger. But hey, immortality.</p>
<p>In After Sundown, these creatures often hang out at the edges of society - places which while nominally explored aren't actually <em>watched</em> very carefully.</p>

<h2 id="the-non-playable-types"><a class="header" href="#the-non-playable-types">The Non-Playable Types</a></h2>
<p>Not only must we make explicit what appears on the player's side, we also need to decide ahead of time what is around, supernaturally speaking <em>in the world</em>. Many people protest this. If they want to have unicorns show up for a storyline, why shouldn't they, as the MC, just do that? The answer is that in a cooperative storytelling game, the players need some sort of ground state to tell their own backstories and to make plans for future intrigue. Whether or not the <em>character</em> knows that such and such a creature exists or such and such a world-spanning organization is up to its evil schemes, the <em>player</em> needs to at the very least have access to that information. And while it may seem like that would spoil surprises - and it does sometimes - in a much more important way it prevents <em>narrative dissonance</em>. Narrative dissonance appears in cooperative storytelling games much the way continuity errors appear in horror films. And while it is certainly jarring to watch the part in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107387/">Leprechaun</a> where they drive off in the second car even though they had earlier lamented being stranded when the first car wouldn't start - it is still a movie and thus the plot (such as it is) just keeps rolling along whether you notice the discrepancy or not. In a cooperative storytelling game however, such an event would just crash everything to a halt. The players and the MC would have to sit down and work something out because they are all imagining the world together and there is no &quot;next scene&quot; until everyone gets their imaginations working together.</p>
<h3 id="zombies"><a class="header" href="#zombies">Zombies</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;Brains!&quot;</em></p>
<p>Zombies are the result of evil magic, ghastly diseases, or super-science which transforms dead bodies into lurching, brain-eating monsters. Zombies have an insatiable hunger for the living and a tendency to rampage constantly. Some zombies are fast, some are slow. Some can figure out doorknobs and others can't. But they all hunger for the living. Zombies can create new zombies just by killing extras, so zombie outbreaks can get really big, really fast.</p>

<h3 id="goblins"><a class="header" href="#goblins">Goblins</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;Ha! Ha!&quot;</em></p>
<p>Some of the faeries in horror movies come from the same ghastly hell dimension that the demons do. These are <em>not</em> the shimmering pixies from Neverland, these are the hideous flesh-eating goblins from the Goblin Market. They come in small and extra-large sizes, and are generally easy to confuse.</p>

<p><em>&quot;Elves are terrific. They beget terror.&quot;</em></p>
<p>The other faeries of horror are a slightly more subtle lot if all the more terrifying for it. While they do include shimmering pixies, they're just there to lure you in so the servants of the court may decide how your life will be spent away. And some of them are happy to <em>pretend</em> to be aliens if that's what makes people scream the right way.</p>

<p><em>&quot;My God!&quot;<br />
&quot;Not yet, human. Soon... very soon I will be.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Made entirely of evil magic, the demons are a strange force that seeks to hurt humans and steal souls. Some appear as beautiful humans with or without horns and wings, and others look like the most nightmarish beasts the special effects budget could afford.</p>

<p><em>&quot;Boo!&quot;</em></p>
<p>When humans die and they are <em>super pissed</em> about something, they will occasionally linger on after death and become a ghost. Ghosts don't interact properly with physical objects and other people, and in any case are fed only by strong human emotions. So they gradually lose themselves and go batshit crazy, becoming a force that is more and more destructive.</p>

<p><em>&quot;But I wanted to know what it was like... how you feel.&quot;</em></p>
<p>In the Gloom there are things worse than the dead. Things that were never alive, but just pretend to be so they can walk among us and drink our lives like parasites. Their bodies are as hollow inside as their souls, and they wear dark glasses to hide the holes where their eyes should be. The least of them are barely more than plastic-looking zombies, but some grow strong and cunning on stolen life and memory.</p>

<p><em>&quot;Rar!&quot;</em></p>
<p>The wilderness of horror is a dangerous place with a spectacularly large array of things that can kill you. Man-eating beasts of tremendous size roam the woods, the lakes, the swamps, and probably the mountains. Being eaten by sharks, crocodiles, tigers, or <em>whatever</em> is a severe threat. And yes, these super charged zoo rejects have magic powers sometimes.</p>

<p><em>&quot;These things live on death and feed on ash.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Like demons and goblins, the great inhuman monsters of legend are trapped beyond the mortal world. While such things may have once walked the earth and hunted man, they are now limited to Limbo unless summoned by the foolish. When they do come out the world burns with their fury.</p>

<p>The evil plants grow out of the ground in weird pods that make the soundtrack want to bust out theremin tracks.  They grow out of humans and often have mind control and other weird powers. These things might actually <em>be</em> from Space. But since they don't have a civilization or space ships (that we know of), it's not super important.</p>

<h2 id="monstrous-society"><a class="header" href="#monstrous-society">Monstrous Society</a></h2>
<p><em>&quot;There's evil stuff going on in here. And I want in.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Supernatural creatures are in the big scheme of things rather rare. An individual Werewolf may go their entire life without ever encountering another supernatural creature (beyond of course the Werewolf that mauled them into their current state in the first place). When they <em>do</em> find each other they tend to make exclusive clubs for their own safety. While an ordinary human is no match for a supernatural creature on their own, a group of humans can be a different story, so the monsters that survive tend to be the ones that form groups of their own. These social organizations are in many ways templated on the human social organizations that the creatures that created them lived in when they mingled in human society. And with the sheer <em>age</em> that some creatures possess, it is perhaps unsurprising that many of these organizations are in fact crazy old-fashioned.</p>
<h3 id="bands"><a class="header" href="#bands">Bands</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;Go Team Venture!&quot;</em></p>
<p>Supernatural creatures can easily overpower a single human, and many of them have at least the potential to <em>live forever</em>. But that potential can only be realized if they are not summarily destroyed before forever draws near. The response has been for small groups of supernatural creatures to watch each other's backs and contribute to each others' goals. These small teams are just as needed and just as effective as the hunting parties mankind first organized to fight cave bears. It has been suggested that the practice of supernatural creatures making these bands is perhaps no less old.</p>
<p>Loyalty to these small groups, whether you call it a &quot;band&quot; or &quot;team&quot; or &quot;coven&quot; or &quot;pack&quot; or &quot;family&quot; or just &quot;Fred&quot;, is assumed to be greater than loyalty to any world-spanning clubs. The Makhzen does not <em>expect</em> that you will betray your friends for them because it seriously isn't like you can go out and get new friends, especially if you have a reputation as a traitor. Immortality is a long time, and the number of supernaturals is never that large, so personal loyalties are considered extremely important by just about every one.</p>
<p>Most bands are generally 3-8 supernatural people with possibly some trusted retainers given quasi-membership. This is great for the game because one of them could very well be &quot;the player characters and maybe an NPC or two&quot;. And indeed, the general assumption is that players <em>will</em> be part of the same band. Doing things this way allows the mission statement of the band to act like Velcro to attach plot hooks to every player character, ensuring that the major action doesn't leave anyone behind. A band of Scooby Doo detectives can get all the players into the action right away when any of the characters find out about a supposedly haunted house, while a band of relic hunters can get the players up to speed with just the subtlest hint about the whereabouts of a famous pistol. Even a band of guys who meet together for pizza and poker night can be righteously mobilized when supernatural goings-on hamper their evening ritual.</p>
<p>Bands are thus structurally a very important part of the story arc for any group playing After Sundown because they provide a <em>reason</em> for the players to be telling the same story instead of having their characters drift apart and do their own thing. It is also important to note that many of the famous bands from genre television shows like X Files, American Gothic, and Supernatural only have two characters in them much of the time. Since After Sundown <em>is</em> a cooperative storytelling game, that is an unreasonable expectation to have. A better template would usually be the bands from more ensemble cast shows like Angel or even Scooby Doo.</p>
<h3 id="syndicates"><a class="header" href="#syndicates">Syndicates</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;New plan: we <strong>don't</strong> cut each other's head off in an attempt to gain asymmetric power.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Whether they like it or not, supernatural characters in After Sundown are subject to the rules and judgments of one or more of the Syndicates. Acting as de facto nation-states, Syndicates provide a Hobbesian mandate of behavior that is difficult to ignore. Characters may indeed be a member of one of them, which provides benefits comparable to those of being the citizen of an archaic empire. However, breaking the edicts of <strong>any</strong> Syndicate is punishable by that Syndicate if it catches you (subject to possible negotiations if you are a well-placed member of another).</p>
<p>The Syndicates do not have directly analogous social hierarchies. Each is kind of like a mafia, with <em>some</em> sort of shady leadership hierarchy and elaborate titles to convey subtle differences in duties and status. But they were generally founded centuries and continents apart from one another, an they are not based on identical or even <em>comparable</em> theories of government. However, while each has very different justifications for its own existence, all the Syndicates exist to fulfill essentially the same functions and are essentially on the same side. So while they spend a fair amount of time insulting one another, it is profoundly unusual for them to actually come to blows. Each Syndicate provides the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Preserves the Vow of Silence</strong> - each group calls it something different, but everyone is keenly aware that sufficient numbers of peasants with torches have slain supernatural creatures in the past and will do so again if the lid isn't kept on pretty tight. In ages past this was handled with the &quot;Tradition of Misdirection&quot; where humans were fed bullshit about how magic really worked, when that started to break down during the Classical era, it was replaced with a system where supernatural creatures hid their existence from mortal observation entirely.</li>
<li><strong>Facilitates Social Interaction</strong> - for all the Nosferatu babble about how they prefer the life of the hermit, they really don't. Normal humans are incapable of really understanding what it is like to be a supernatural creature and really the only peers a Leviathan has is other Leviathans, or at least other supernatural creatures. Syndicates not only provide places and structure for this but will even make introductions for you.</li>
<li><strong>Acts as a framework to work out differences</strong> - supernatural creatures exist outside and in many ways above normal human societies, and live their life very much like a Hobbesian battle of All against All. And while it is true that their power and mystery does make them well qualified to do that, they have no unique advantages over other supernatural creatures. And thus it is in true Hobbes fashion the creatures have put together over organizations to keep each other in check.</li>
</ul>
<p>Syndicates do not, as a rule, recognize dual citizenship or anything of the like. And switching one's status from one to another is a slow painful process that generally just isn't done. But a supernatural creature from one Syndicate can generally expect to not get stabbed in the face or eaten by members of another. A supernatural creature from another Syndicate can expect to be treated as a foreigner, but not as a foreigner from a nation that is at war with the local one. Indeed, since all the Syndicates are international and borders are pretty vague even when they exist at all you can pretty much go where you want without getting much more than the fish eye. And that mostly from Leviathans who actually have fish eyes.</p>
<p>While various Syndicates have come and gone under various names, there are four extant in the modern world that make up pretty much the totality of ordered life among civilized monsters.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Makhzen:</strong> The oldest surviving Syndicate, the Makhzen are a shockingly baroque and millennia-old gathering of monsters supposedly dating back to ancient Babylon. Their Princes and Councils rule domains organized like the city states of antiquity still stretched across the path of the Silk Road.</li>
<li><strong>The Covenant:</strong> A quasi-Satanic inverted hierarchy that openly mocks the Catholic church of late antiquity in its structure. The Covenant has spread along much the same routes and holds territory in Southern Europe and Central America.</li>
<li><strong>The World Crime League:</strong> A group of former Makhzen domains that broke away in the midst of a Mongol invasion into Southwest Asia, the League reorganized itself as a pirate's council and has spread around the Pacific Rim on the back of organized crime.</li>
<li><strong>The Cauchemar Communes:</strong> Radical young (only centuries-old) monsters staged their own revolution against the power of the Covenant in the midst of the French Revolution and have swarmed much of the world along with the diaspora of political modernity.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="antagonistic-organizations"><a class="header" href="#antagonistic-organizations">Antagonistic Organizations</a></h2>
<p><em>&quot;Actually, those guys are just bastards. We fight them.&quot;</em></p>
<p>What makes an antagonist organization different from a &quot;normal&quot; organization in After Sundown is not that they are &quot;the bad guys&quot; - after all it is abundantly clear that a substantial number of people in <em>all</em> the supernatural societies are <em>bad guys</em>. These organizations are filled with blood-drinking <em>monsters</em>. No, the salient thing about the Antagonists in this setting is that they are not willing to live and let live with the members of other Syndicates and cults. So while it is entirely possible to have a story in which one character is from the Makhzen and another is from the Communes, it is basically impossible to have a cogent story in which one character is in the Marduk Society and the other characters are not.</p>
<p>The assumption then is that the antagonist organizations will be NPC only. The player characters will be members of the standard Syndicates or independents and as such the warriors of the Shattered Empire who show up at all it will do so as enemies. It is entirely possible to play a campaign in which every character is a member of the Marduk society, and that's fine. If you weren't OK with playing a game that skated closely to the edge of evil you wouldn't be playing a game about vampires and werewolves.</p>
<p>However, it's equally important to note that just because the King with Three Shadows may be a <em>villain</em> who is basically <em>at war</em> with the World Crime League, that does not mean that anyone is automatically on kill-on-sight terms with anyone else. Even these antagonistic organizations have diplomatic ties of some sort or another with all of the major Syndicates. These ties are <em>strained</em>, and ambassadors are sometimes recalled, but actual shooting wars have causes, beginnings, and negotiated <em>ends</em>.</p>
<p>Three major antagonist organizations can rival the Syndicates:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Marduk Society:</strong></li>
<li><strong>The King with Three Shadows:</strong></li>
<li><strong>The Shattered Empire:</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cults"><a class="header" href="#cults">Cults</a></h2>
<p><em>&quot;Has it ever occurred to you that maybe, just maybe, all the crazy pointless crap we do isn't crazy or pointless?&quot;</em></p>
<p>Many magical creatures attempt to increase their magical power by sharing secrets of magic with other supernatural creatures. These mystical file sharing groups serve as secret clubs, religious heresies, and trade guilds. These organizations are semi-secret. While their membership is largely composed of supernatural creatures (whose very existence is a secret from the mundane humans of the world), the specific activities of these groups are kept under wraps even from other supernaturals.</p>
<p>Each Cult is distinguished largely by 3 things. The first is their <strong>Favored Magic</strong>. This is the path of Sorcery that a character can reasonably expect to be taught by joining and advancing within the cult. The second is the <strong>Favored Resources</strong>. These are two resources that a character gets easily whilst a member of the cult in good standing. Further, the character's status within the cult is in some way enhanced by having lots of these backgrounds. And finally there is the <strong>Work</strong>. This is what the cult <em>does</em> in and around supernatural society. For example, the Ulmi family business is finance and bureaucracy, so other supernaturals frequently hire them to navigate human legalities on their behalf. On the flip side, The Black Hand makes it a point to murder people in cold blood, and supernaturals are rarely above hiring <em>them</em> to hammer down nails judged to be standing up.</p>
<p>A note on how to integrate each Cult's work into your chronicle has been included in each Cult's description. Each group has agendas that are in many ways fairly sketchy - and it is not at all inconceivable that the characters may find themselves working with or against any of them. Indeed, it's highly likely that characters will end up teaming up with and opposing the <em>same group</em> at different times. Cults fit a role somewhere between the Syndicates and purely antagonistic organizations in most chronicles.</p>
<p>While a cult could be as small as a single band, there are a few that span the world, or beyond. These major cults aren't a permanent presence in every city, but their agents often come and go throughout the supernatural world.</p>

<p><em>&quot;When you say 'the world' do you mean 'Earth', or 'where we are now'?&quot;</em></p>
<p>After Sundown takes place in a world with many similarities to our own. A world which has the same countries and cities as the ones we are familiar with, and which is therefore one which you can research by reading about actual places in history and physical space. But it is also secretly full of magic and evil and beasts and slashers from horror fiction. It also has connections to three coterminous magic worlds full of monsters and danger.</p>
<p>It is in short: a game that takes place in the realm of horror rather than the realm of the real. You're playing a cooperative storytelling game, and the genre is horror. It may be action-horror, horror-mystery, horror-comedy, or even horror-romance, but it is always horror.</p>
<h2 id="a-life-in-horror-the-good-and-the-bad"><a class="header" href="#a-life-in-horror-the-good-and-the-bad">A Life in Horror: The Good and The Bad</a></h2>
<p><em>&quot;Interesting fact: The Final Girl trope emerged shortly after young women became a major component of horror movie attendees.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Life for the common man in After Sundown is actually pretty horrible, and extremely dangerous. Life in After Sundown is life in a horror movie. Or rather, it is a world not unlike Earth would be if all the horror movies were real in different places and at different times. This means that body counts are extremely high, and it is very difficult to get help. This is good news if you happen to be the Bogie Man, but really bad for anyone looking for a life of vaguely normal properties. Here are some important things to remember:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Police are no help at all.</strong> Heavily infiltrated by cultists and secret societies, the police in After Sundown are astoundingly ineffective. Sure they will <em>occasionally</em> bring down a killer, but the vast majority of crimes go unsolved. Many crimes don't even get investigated, especially if something supernatural is afoot. Official records and evidence disappear all the time and not much is said or even noticed about it. Crime in general is more comparable to the 1970s than to contemporary times.</li>
<li><strong>Telecommunications are Shoddy.</strong> Sat Phones aren't generally reliable in the realm of horror. Cellphone coverage cuts out constantly at inopportune moments. Most people still have landlines, but regular telecommunication wires go down frequently and are out for days at a time. The inability to get a call out of a building or town isn't unusual, that kind of thing happens a lot in After Sundown. Even with a solid connection things on the Internet are likely to be lost, forgotten, or just unavailable even more often in the real world</li>
<li><strong>People Don't Travel Much.</strong> It's not <em>weird</em> for people to not know what goes on in the next town over in After Sundown. Things are just more dangerous, and people keep to themselves more. International travel and vacations may still happen, but people are even more likely to stick to tourist areas and no one is surprised when people that wander off the path aren't seen again.</li>
<li><strong>More People Just Vanish</strong> In the real United States, each year about 2700 people go missing and are never found (besides hundreds of thousands that do turn up). With all the people becoming or being eaten by monsters, the world of After Sundown averages at least twice that, and without much notice - after all, doubling the rate in the lower 48 doesn't even come close to the rate in the real Alaska, and the police seriously don't want to look any harder.</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep this in mind when you're planning your nights in the realm of horror. Life is cheaper and less connected to other life in the realm of horror and it is <em>much</em> easier for dangerous elements to thrive in such an environment.</p>
<p>That being said, it is important to remember that most horror movies begin with people thinking things are pretty normal, and <em>end</em> with something of a return to normalcy as well (or do they?) So it's not like Jason is running around the streets murdering people left and right. Indeed, while the death rate from serial and mass murder may seem to be large enough in the realm of horror to compete with traffic accidents or opiate abuse, even then,
the fact is that you're still more likely to die from cancer. Supernatural creatures remain hidden and the president of the United States is openly a mundane human. A vampire can't just flash their fangs to get free entry to a movie theater, and indeed they could be in a lot of trouble if they flash their fangs in a public space of any kind.</p>
<h2 id="the-four-worlds"><a class="header" href="#the-four-worlds">The Four Worlds</a></h2>
<p><em>&quot;Things are crawling in all over the place these days.&quot;</em></p>
<p>A very common trope in horror is the inclusion of additional worlds that are full of terror and danger. This is very useful since of course having an extra world around allows you to fit things into the narrative that would be otherwise very difficult to fit into the Earth. Demon armies, forgotten cities, and strange and deadly plants can be piled to the sky and beyond without otherwise upsetting the world provided that they were never in the world in the first place. Furthermore, the idea that monsters can come in sideways is by itself a wonderfully useful notion for the horror genre, because it severely undermines the concept of safety in a fortress or locked room. It also provides places for the supernatural - players and their antagonists in particular - to really cut loose in a way that would draw undue attention in normal society.</p>
<p>That being said, it is also true that there are a lot of alternate worlds to be had in various stories. Too <em>many</em> alternate worlds to be anything vaguely approaching something workable. And so it is that as a compromise we have cut things down to three alternate realities:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Earth: The Mortal World</strong> This is the world where most people live. It's just like our world except magic and monsters are real. And it's connected to the three other worlds. It is portrayed in virtually every horror movie because it <em>is</em> the world of every horror movie.</li>
<li><strong>Limbo: The Dark Reflection</strong> The best rendition of the Dark Reflection is probably in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0384537/">Silent Hill</a>, although the Hell of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0360486/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1">Constantine</a> is also apt. It's a world very much like our own but scoured with demonic powers. Ash falls from the sky like rain and everything looks abandoned or scorched. Demons prowl the Dark Reflection.</li>
<li><strong>Maya: The Dreamlands</strong> Think of a combination of the untamed and deadly dreamworlds of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113497/">Jumanji</a> or <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0386117/">Where the Wild Things Are</a>. This is where dreams and wild things go, but since this is the realm of horror the dreams are often as not inspired by Freddy and the beasts are likely to be deadly and destructive monsters.</li>
<li><strong>Mictlan: The Gloom</strong> The best rendition of the Gloom is of course in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0403358/">Night Watch</a>, which even calls it that. It's a cold and oppressive world where darkness presses insistently upon the light and heat of travelers. Powers of death leak in from every crevice and extinguish fires and the lives of small animals. Blood hungering insects and ghosts scour the Gloom.</li>
</ul>
<p>Collectively, these alternative supernatural places are called the Otherworlds. Gates pass among them, and each of the supernatural worlds can bleed into the mortal world. In short, like in <em>Silent Hill</em>, it is possible to straddle the worlds where you can still open and close the door of your house and see what's on the stove but demons from the Dark Reflection can attack you. It's also possible to be all the way in the Dark Reflection, where things are a terrifying hellscape and nothing makes any sense. While in a Bleed of any of the worlds, the celestial realities of Earth appear to hold sway - the Sun rises and sets while wind and rain appear on schedule. Fully in the other world it becomes apparent that one is quite likely <em>not on Earth</em>, as the sky itself betrays one to be on an alien rock.</p>
<p>These worlds are more than just places; for supernatural beings they are sources of power. Most of the <em>playable</em> monsters come in a subtype for each power source. In addition, each world hosts it's own native monsters. Further power flows from each world and is codified into the Disciplines for each source.</p>
<h3 id="shallows"><a class="header" href="#shallows">Shallows</a></h3>
<p>The four worlds are mostly coextensive, with something like continents, oceans, and other coarse geography in more-or-less similar locations, for reasons that are often speculated upon but have few satisfying or reliable answers. Human geography is a little more complicated, but often follows somewhat predictable patterns. For example, from a theater in Chicago, a sorcerer might be able to glimpse the remains of a burned building in the window's reflections, dream of a living skyscraper hiding a tiny group of Jalus, or conjure the ghosts of those that died in the back alley.</p>
<p>Normally, a character in the mortal world is safe from attack from things actually in the other worlds and cannot be physically affected by them. Normal people cannot perceive or touch things in other worlds while they are in the Mortal World. Some disciplines allow characters to perceive, or even reach into, things that actually in the parallel parts of other worlds. So for example, if your character has Necromancy, they can perceive goings-on in the Gloom, but they are still safe from physically being harmed by creatures or objects there. When a character moves completely from one world to another, they come out in the nearest place that they can fit, which in some cases will be several meters away from their relative location in the original world. The character will appear to be hallucinating to observers from either world (who aren't also subject to the same power) because there are things (most especially creatures) that are in only one world and not the other.</p>
<h3 id="depths"><a class="header" href="#depths">Depths</a></h3>
<p>One complication of all of the Otherworlds is that their are more directions present than on Earth. In addition to moving about in three dimensions one can move nearer or farther from the Earth. The places that do not directly correspond to a place in the Mortal World or its past are collectively referred to as the <em>Depths</em>, places farther away from Earth in nature as well as distance. The strangest and most powerful inhabitants of the other worlds tend to dwell or at least arise in these places.</p>
<p>Due to this extra and largely imperceptible aspect of the Otherworlds navigation is considerably more difficult and dangerous than in the Mortal World. Trying to navigate through the Dark Reflection between two Earthly mirrors might put one on a much shorter or longer path than on Earth or lead to different places altogether.</p>
<h3 id="bleeds"><a class="header" href="#bleeds">Bleeds</a></h3>
<p>There are places where the worlds merge, where a character is literally in two worlds because the ground itself is in two worlds. The experience of this is no different than being in just one world at a time because in such places there is only one table in the room. And while said table may be in the style of an Earthly table or a table of Limbo, it will still be a single solid object. Where things get weird is at the edges of the Bleed, where a character inside may see two different outsides. Bleeds oscillate between sending those who leave to one world or the other. Sometimes this is very simple (such as opening a door onto either a blighted hellscape or a normal suburban street), and sometimes it's just plain hard to figure out (such as the difference between a foggy forest and a foggy forest that happens to be in Maya). Bleeds are often temporary or come and go with strange patterns in time.</p>
<h3 id="gateways"><a class="header" href="#gateways">Gateways</a></h3>
<p>TK</p>
<ul>
<li>Limbo: Burnt Rents, Mirror Gates</li>
<li>Maya: Moon Gates (or Faerie Rings?), Dream Tears</li>
<li>Mictlan: Wells, Shadow Gates</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="limbo-the-dark-reflection"><a class="header" href="#limbo-the-dark-reflection">Limbo: The Dark Reflection</a></h2>
<p><em>&quot;You can go to hell!&quot;<br />
&quot;We can't. Not alone...&quot;</em></p>
<p>A long time ago, some people fucked up really bad and parts of the human world started to fall into the fires of The Dark Reflection. Nobody's quite sure exactly when or what - some say that it was the cinders of the atomic fires of Oklo, while others say it is the ancient truth contained in the myth of Prometheus and the Scriptural references to Gehenna; some that men merely opened the doorway into the world of ashes; others say that it was men that started the unquenchable fire that begat The Dark Reflection.</p>
<p>Practically everything found in Limbo was first wrought by humans, and then destroyed by fire. Everywhere in the Dark Reflection there are always remnants of human habitation, and everywhere in the dark reflection, there are always smoke and ashes. Yet it is exceedingly rare to encounter men still living nor open flames still burning. The ground is littered with sooty broken glass: smashed bottles, shattered windows, and  shards of obsidian lie on every surface. The dusty surfaces seem dull, and rarely cast a reflection. When they do, they seem more of a window back to the mortal realm, a cruel reminder of where the onlooker is and where they could be. The sky is perpetually obscured by oppressive smoke and rain falls only infrequently (in many places less than once a year) and it is black with ash when it lands.</p>
<p>The Dark Reflection knows neither day nor night, and languishes eternally in a twilight illumination that comes from between one and four vaguely definable lighter patches in the sky that may well be suns or moons. Limbo is home to trapped horrors such as demons, goblins, and hellspawn such as dragons. All of them endeavor merely to survive long enough to escape. Survival is a brutal matter of scavenging amongst the cinders and preying upon the weaker residents. Escape is more difficult, never more than a temporary respite: for each of the dwellers of The Dark Reflection carry the seed of the unquenchable fire within them, and any who escape are doomed to one day start a blaze which will drag another piece of the human world back into The Dark Reflection.</p>
<h2 id="getting-to-the-dark-reflection"><a class="header" href="#getting-to-the-dark-reflection">Getting to the Dark Reflection</a></h2>
<p><em>&quot;Fire doesn't cleanse, it blackens.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Natural passages in and out of the Dark Reflection are almost always through fires or mirrored surfaces, and it is the latter possibility that gives it its name. Sometimes when something is burned, a rend between the mortal world and the Dark Reflection is left in its place. This is most likely to happen when the burnt thing in question was a source of security such as the wall of a family home or school, or a child's blanket. On the other hand, underground coal seam fires seem to be particularly likely to result in long-term recurring bleeds and are carefully but discretely watched by the Syndicates. Once a character has been to the Dark Reflection even once, these portals appear far more commonly in their presence for the rest of their lives. Those who have been to the Dark Reflection often find themselves avoiding mirrors for fear that they will find the profane staring back at them.</p>
<p>Sorcerous means to enter and escape the Dark Reflection can be found in Infernal Sorcery paths. Leaving the Dark Reflection is difficult for magical creatures. Whether traveling by sorcery or through a gateway from Limbo to the Mortal World requires one to make a Resistance Test (Social if attempting to traverse a summoning, Mental if attempting to pass through a mirror gate, or Physical if attempting to navigate a burnt rend in space) with a Threshold equal to their own Potency. Summoning rituals and special gate preparations can add additional bonus dice in addition to allowing for an Escape Test at all. The property of being difficult to leave is called &quot;The Gauntlet,&quot; and it can render the Dark Reflection a near inescapable prison for the very powerful. For example, The King With Three Shadows has a Potency of 10 and suffers from a <em>name binding</em> that further raises his escape threshold to 15. The locations of truly epic firestorms have left certain portals that waive these restrictions for supernatural creatures of a Potency equal to or less than their Rating.</p>
<h3 id="inhabitants-of-limbo"><a class="header" href="#inhabitants-of-limbo">Inhabitants of Limbo</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;It's being invaded by the Otherworld. By a world of someone's nightmarish delusions come to life.&quot;</em></p>
<p>The majority of natives of the Dark Reflection are Goblins and Demons. These beings are generally pretty uncooperative and rarely are on good terms with any of the major Syndicates. Hellspawn are even worse, and have no society to speak of. The King with Three Shadows has a strong presence in Limbo and has substantially more territory than any other there. World War II created copies virtually intact of several cities in Limbo, and many of them are used by one or more supernatural groups as bases of operation. The firestorms of Dresden created a dusty and scorched copy of that place in the Dark Reflection which is even now inhabited by a fringe of the Covenant. The Rape of Nanking left a level 5 portal to a reflection of the city of Nanjing that is mostly used as a smuggling port by the World Crime League. Herculaneum, Pompeii, Hangzhou, London, and Chicago have older copies still used by various groups.</p>
<p>Not everything in Limbo is a supernatural creature. There are some real humans there, and they are sad people. Food is scarce in the Dark Reflection, and the nightmarish imagery is usually enough to drive those who fall into Limbo to madness and depravity. Most become demonic pawns. However, demonic pawn or not, a human has no Potency and can pass through the narrowest of portals. All too often, by the time they reach an egress they are already committed to serving dark lords by kidnapping other humans from the mortal world and then <em>returning</em> to the land of their torment.</p>
<h3 id="things-to-do-in-hell"><a class="header" href="#things-to-do-in-hell">Things to Do in Hell</a></h3>
<p>For those able to overcome the gauntlet, Limbo can be a convenient way to get around. There's little traffic and one could potentially appear from any burn or mirror, things that happen to appear in otherwise terribly secure places. Of course, you have to not be eaten on the way, and those things that can't eat you might follow you instead.</p>
<p>Because so many things that are lost to the mortal world are copied in Limbo in can be attractive to hunters of lost lore and treasure, although few indeed return with what they are looking for.</p>
<h3 id="infernal-magic"><a class="header" href="#infernal-magic">Infernal Magic</a></h3>
<p>The Dark Reflection is a horrible place from which few things escape. But its reach and grasp can be felt far outside the ashen pits of Limbo itself. Infernal Disciplines are those magics that manipulate and harness the taint of that parched landscape and turn them to one's own advantage. Major varieties of the magic of Limbo can call upon corruption, fire, reflections, names, and insects in ways that seem blatantly impossible and terrifying.</p>
<h2 id="maya-the-dreamlands"><a class="header" href="#maya-the-dreamlands">Maya: The Dreamlands</a></h2>
<p><em>&quot;Everybody's got to dream, young girl. If you don't dream, ya go crazy.&quot;<br />
&quot;Go crazy? Don't mind if I do!&quot;</em></p>
<p>The Dreamlands are a wild and inhospitable place filled with fetid jungles and monstrous beasts. Overgrown with dreadful, implacable, and nightmarish life in all world correspondences - even those in the far north and south of the planet (though it still gets wicked cold at extreme latitudes). No one really knows if Maya is a construct of subconscious thought or the manifestation of a distant world that exists independently of our own. What is clear is that Maya is <em>connected</em> to the dreams of the frightened and the suffering. This world seems somewhat unreal even for those who have traveled to it in the flesh, and the native inhabitants are strange and otherworldly even by the standards set by other supernatural creatures.</p>
<p>Maya does not even necessarily have climactic similarities with its Mortal World correspondences. It boasts floating rocks and sideways waterfalls. And monstrous beasts. And psychic plants. And sometimes the jungles are made more of flesh than wood and vines, interspersed with terrifying wonders such as mountains of fused teeth. What buildings exist are chaotic and senseless. There are few reasons for the sane to want to go to Maya even though it is wondrous and beautiful in its alien and unforgiving fashion. The weather is reminiscent of the Yucatan, with dense cloud cover and frequent, driving rain or storms coming almost every day. On those rare times that the night sky is visible, it is clear that the stars above are unfamiliar. The sky boasts no sun or moon, so where precisely the light comes from in the &quot;daytime&quot; is a matter of speculation.</p>
<h3 id="getting-to-maya"><a class="header" href="#getting-to-maya">Getting to Maya</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;If you die in your dreams, you make me a sandwich.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Perhaps the easiest way to get to The Dreamlands is to <em>go to sleep</em>. While not even a small fraction of dreamers are transported across the barrier, it is nonetheless possible for virtually anyone to make the passage while they are sleeping. A dreamer's physical body remains where it is while the consciousness projects into Maya. If the person dies in the Dreamlands, the body dies as well. If the body dies, the dreamer is lost in Maya indefinitely and becomes a Jalus. There are places where the barrier between Maya and the sleeping mind is weaker. Generally speaking, places with horrible <em>personal</em> murders are more conducive to slipping people across into the nightmare realm. Impersonal deaths, such as natural disasters and battles make the barrier more difficult to cross. Some practice strange disciplines of lucid dreaming or take ill-advised drugs to increase their chances of reaching the strange realm. Physical gateways, though rare, also exist. They are always circles of something, and one crosses the boundary by entering and then exiting the circle. Circles of mushrooms or trees are fairly common as gateways go, but theoretically it could be a circle of anything. In any case, these gateways only function when the moon is visible. Sorcerous means of entering the Dreamlands are found in Astral Sorceries.</p>
<h3 id="inhabitants-of-the-dreamlands"><a class="header" href="#inhabitants-of-the-dreamlands">Inhabitants of the Dreamlands</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;We shall build a tower that shall reach to the stars.&quot;</em></p>
<p>The majority of inhabitants of Maya are neither human nor derived from human stock. Massive monsters stalk the lands and even the plants themselves chitter with an otherworldly malevolence. Fae courts order themselves with inhuman pomp and cruelty, trapping mortal slaves in a pointless ritual or Sisyphean tasks. The Evil Plants in Maya speak to travelers only infrequently. Some can speak telepathically, but they mostly choose not to do so, preferring total domination or consumption of humans. The Giant Animals generally simply attempt to devour anything they come across. While delicious (if alien) fruit and clear water are available year-round and in great quantity, The Dreamlands have the least expatriate civilization from the Mortal world of all the other worlds.</p>
<p>Not everything in this dimension is from another world, however. Sometimes tribes of Jalus congregate together. And for reasons , The Marduk Society has been growing an Arcanotower in the Brazil Correspondence for some time. They patrol that area and keep it <em>mostly</em> clear of Giant Animals, but at least some Evil Plants seem to be allowed free reign to enter the trans-dimensional compound.</p>
<h3 id="things-to-do-in-nightmare"><a class="header" href="#things-to-do-in-nightmare">Things to Do in Nightmare</a></h3>
<p>Among the nightmares exist a few true wonders. Things only dreamed of may exist there, not to mention the strangest forms of life that can be studied. Dreamers can also be interrogated with little consequence to reveal sensitive things in the mortal world.</p>
<h3 id="astral-magic"><a class="header" href="#astral-magic">Astral Magic</a></h3>
<p>The mercurial rain of the Deep Maya has an origin that few can even speculate upon. But whether The Dreamlands represent an intrusion of our subconscious minds into the realm of the physical or the intrusion of an alien realm into our sleeping thoughts, the fact remains that it is a source of power that those who delve deeply into its mysteries can tap. Astral Sorceries are spells and powers that tap into that strange reality. Magic from Maya has a tendency to be as untamed and inhuman as the implacable beasts and plants that inhabit it.
Astral powers can variously affect plants, animals, weather, and dreams, often appearing as strange perversions of the natural order.</p>
<h2 id="mictlan-the-gloom"><a class="header" href="#mictlan-the-gloom">Mictlan: The Gloom</a></h2>
<p><em>&quot;Some people believe that when you die there is a wonderful light. As bright as the sun but it doesn't hurt to look into it. All the answers to all the questions you want to know are inside that light. Truth is... there is no light. Only darkness.&quot;</em></p>
<p>The Gloom has been around forever. Some say that it is space itself and the big bang created the human world as a tiny mote within the Gloom, while others say that the Gloom is the force of entropy to which all things shall return in The End. Whatever the case, The Gloom is supernaturally cold and dark. The ground is bare and everything that lives within The Gloom is hungry all of the time. What plants there are lack essential nutrients and sunlight and cannot grow without blood. All the insects are parasitic.</p>
<p>There are no visible stars in the Deep Gloom. There is no sun in the morning, and no glittering lights in the night. There <em>may</em> be a moon in the sky, but since it is as fixedly black as anything else in the sky it's a matter of debate. Rains never fall and the seas are deathly still. But water and other things rise out of the ground at unpredictable times through a process called &quot;welling&quot;. If you want light in Mictlan, you need to bring it yourself, and even then the illumination cast by a lamp or flashlight is disappointing as if the air itself were a voracious shadow.</p>
<p>The Gloom is home to what the unenlightened would call ghosts, wendigos, and zombies. All of them endeavor to draw prey in from the human world where they may drain the blood, life, and warmth from it to feed their insatiable hungers. The true horror is that such victims do not rest in peace, but instead rise driven by the need to recover the blood, life, and warmth that was taken from them - in an ever-growing cycle of futility. Worse still are the hollow things from the depths, that crave such things as they have never known.</p>
<h3 id="getting-to-mictlan"><a class="header" href="#getting-to-mictlan">Getting to Mictlan</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;Have you ever been killed before? I'll be back in a minute.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Portals to The Gloom are called &quot;wells&quot; and each one is filled with darkness. The most effective portals are holes in the ground filled with shadow and water - literal wells. However in some cases a well will appear which is <em>just</em> a hole filled with water <em>or</em> shadow. In addition, pretty much everyone goes to Mictlan just by dying. Upon death, a person becomes a ghost, but in most cases they don't seem to last very long. While some ghosts (especially the ghosts of Luminaries) kick around pretty much indefinitely, this being the realm of horror it seems most likely that ghosts simply unravel and fade into oblivion. The land of the dead is indeed a super depressing place. Sorcerous means of entering The Gloom are found in Orphic magic paths.</p>
<p>While in the  Gloom, all Ghosts are solid, able to be seen and to exert force upon objects. In bleeds and to an even greater extent in the mortal world this is not reliably true. So it is that many Ghosts essentially cannot get anything done in the mortal world even if they escape Mictlan through a Well. So while there is no barrier to exit The Gloom as there is for the Dark Reflection, the primary residents mostly do not leave even when they can.</p>
<h3 id="inhabitants-of-the-gloom"><a class="header" href="#inhabitants-of-the-gloom">Inhabitants of the Gloom</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;It was their hands that built this city of ours, Father. But where do the hands belong in your scheme?&quot;<br />
&quot;In their proper place, the depths.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Soulless bodies sink into Mictlan fairly regularly, whereupon they are animated by the hungry energies of The Gloom and become wandering zombies. The dusty plains of Mictlan are pretty dangerous for travelers because of this. The Gloom has been around for a long time, and walls erected don't seem to crumble in the cold stillness of the land of eternal night. Over the millennia many people have found time to erect buildings and even cities. Many of these structures stand vacant, mute testament to the fact that long ago someone cared enough to build them. However, some are still in use. The Shattered Empire has several such cities, usually corresponding to places where no city or even point of interest stands in the Mortal World. Others are less ambitious, where the Ulmi family has a castle in the Gloom Shadow of Venice.</p>
<p>There does not appear to be any specific fixed limit to how long a Ghost can persist in The Gloom. So even though most last only very short amounts of time, it is entirely possible that any particular historical figure still exists somewhere in Mictlan. Some Ghosts, unhappy with the idea of wandering through a frozen desert for all eternity have taken the time to put up buildings and even societies. The largest such Ancestor City is at about the same place as Beijing.</p>
<h3 id="things-to-do-in-death"><a class="header" href="#things-to-do-in-death">Things to Do in Death</a></h3>
<p>Theoretically, anything known to the dead might be found in Mictlan, but good luck finding those that know it. Past relics, monuments, and grave goods persist here and there, and in the depths are things that might have been but were never born.</p>
<h3 id="orphic-magic"><a class="header" href="#orphic-magic">Orphic Magic</a></h3>
<p>The Gloom provides power that is dark, timeless, destructive, and very frightening to the living. And for good reason, it truly does act as a window into one's mortality. All living things must eventually die, and all come ultimately to the end in the Gloom. Shadows, blood, silence, the dead, and even utter destruction all dance to the necromancer's tune.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="running-the-game"><a class="header" href="#running-the-game">Running the Game</a></h1>
<p>After Sundown is a collaborative storytelling game, where all the players except one take the roles of the protagonists in an ensemble story set in the realm of horror. The odd player out is the MC, who acts as narrator, director, and actor of last resort for all the other characters in the story. The MC has substantial leeway in interpreting how events unfold and is responsible for much of the writing of the backstory. Nevertheless, the story is still <em>about</em> the player characters, and no one should forget that.</p>
<p>Player characters will have numbers and abilities written on a character sheet that demonstrate what they are capable of, but in most cases the players themselves will determine what their character actually does. When actions are declared, dice are often rolled to determine the results of the action. But when that is not enough (or would be too tedious as is the case for many minor actions), the MC can deterministically assign results.</p>
<p>Actual stories are told cooperatively, with players bringing up events relevant to their character's backstory and possibilities for the MC to consider weaving into the ongoing description of the world and having real first-person narrative control over the actions and dialog of their player character. The MC is sometimes said to be &quot;running&quot; the game because they provide the narrative control on the stage on which the protagonists act.</p>
<h2 id="basic-dice-mechanics-the-test"><a class="header" href="#basic-dice-mechanics-the-test">Basic Dice Mechanics: The Test</a></h2>
<p>When you perform an action with an undetermined outcome you roll a pile of d6s called a <em>Dicepool</em>. Dice which come up as a 5 or 6 are <em>Hits</em>. A task's required number of hits is its <em>Threshold</em>. Any hits gained in addition to that are <em>Net Hits</em> (that is, Net Hits = Hits - Threshold). If a die roll generates enough hits the attempt is a success; otherwise, it's a failure.</p>
<p>The effects one can expect out of getting a number of Hits are proportionately more awesome as the number of hits increases:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th style="text-align: center">Hits</th><th style="text-align: left">Awesomeness</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td style="text-align: center">0</td><td style="text-align: left">Not Awesome. Tying shoes, climbing stairs.</td></tr>

<h3 id="rating"><a class="header" href="#rating">Rating</a></h3>
<p>&quot;Rating&quot; is a term generically used for measuring something that relates to dice mechanics. The unit of a Rating is a &quot;point&quot;, which amounts to one die in a pool or a threshold change of one. The most common Ratings are the Attributes and Skills of characters, but it also can refer to the toughness of objects or the difficulty of working with them, the damage dealt by weapons or deflected by armor, the inherent force of certain Powers, or arbitrary things like the gauntlet between Limbo and Earth. The Rating of an object is often used as the threshold for the most particular actions that would be taken on it, such as a lock having a Rating for how difficult it is to bypass whether with force or finesse.</p>
<h3 id="dicepools"><a class="header" href="#dicepools">Dicepools</a></h3>
<p>Your dicepool is generally speaking a pile of d6s with dice equal to your character's Attribute + Skill, and circumstantial modifiers increase or decrease the number of dice rolled. A human Extra's attributes go up to 9 and their skills up to 6. A supernatural creature's dicepools can go up higher than that because their Potency increases their Attribute maximums and their Edge increases their Skill maximums. As such, it is expected that supernatural critters will roll more dice on actions that their powers apply to than normal humans do.</p>
<h3 id="defaulting"><a class="header" href="#defaulting">Defaulting</a></h3>
<p>Sometimes people try doing something with no idea what they're doing; this is called <em>defaulting</em>. There may be a penalty to the dicepool for defaulting without the appropriate Active Skill or Background to perform the task, generally -1.</p>
<h3 id="buying-hits"><a class="header" href="#buying-hits">Buying Hits</a></h3>
<p>When a character is not under any particular threat or pressure, they may elect to forgo the process of actually rolling dice and simply get one hit for every 4 full dice in their dice pool. This process of &quot;phoning it in&quot; gets usually results in less hits than had they legitimately tried, but it has a strong tendency to work if that's all that is required.</p>
<h3 id="resistance-tests"><a class="header" href="#resistance-tests">Resistance Tests</a></h3>
<p>Sometimes a character will be allowed to <em>resist</em> something being done to them. This is done by rolling dice like normal, save that rather than generating an awesome result, the character is merely reducing the number of hits against them, making whatever is being done to them take less or even no effect. In general, a Physical Resistance Test is simply a Strength roll, a Mental Resistance Test is an Intuition roll, and a Social Resistance Test is a Willpower roll. If a character has an Edge score, it is added to these Resistance tests. When a character is struck with an attack they may be called upon to make a Soak roll, which is a special kind of Physical Resistance Test that also adds their appropriate Armor value to the roll (if any). In most cases, if the Resistance Test reduces the number of hits on a test to zero or less, the original attempt has failed.</p>
<p>Some powers specify that they are resisted by other attributes and this may be extended to other situations at the MC's discretion; Edge is added to these tests as normal.</p>
<h3 id="opposed-tests"><a class="header" href="#opposed-tests">Opposed Tests</a></h3>
<p>When two characters are competing they may each make a test and then the hits are compared to see who has the advantage. In many cases, the effective net hits in such a situation is found by subtracting the losing character's hits from the winner's, as if the loser's dicepool were a resistance test. For example, two characters in a chase would both roll Agility + Athletics, with the net hits representing the degree to which the winner pulled ahead of the loser.</p>
<p>In other circumstances Opposed Tests may use entirely different dicepools, such as attempting to fool a target with a disguise (Charisma + Persuasion) being opposed by (Intuition + Perception)</p>
<h3 id="initiative-tests"><a class="header" href="#initiative-tests">Initiative Tests</a></h3>
<p>When it's important to know which characters act first in a situation - or in what order - an Initiative Test is called for. Each character that wishes to participate rolls Agility + Intuition (an exception to the normal rule that dicepools will be Attribute + Skill) and takes the number of hits as their Initiative Score. Characters act in order of Initiative Scores, and characters whose scores are the same act simultaneously. A character who gets a higher Initiative Score may choose to act <em>after</em> characters with a lower Initiative Score if they want.</p>
<h3 id="extended-tests-and-timescale"><a class="header" href="#extended-tests-and-timescale">Extended Tests and Timescale</a></h3>
<p>Most actions take an expected amount of time. If a character gets the requisite number of hits, they succeed in the expected amount of time. If they get more than the requisite number of hits, they may complete the task well ahead of schedule. For every hit made in excess of the minimum, move to the next lower amount of time on the time chart. If a character fails to succeed, they may retry, but only after having put in the normal time into the first shot. So for example: Mina is attempting to paint a house (Strength + Artisan, 1, 2 days) and gets 3 hits. Since she got 2 more hits than she needed, she can go to the next lower time period twice, bringing the time frame down to five hours.</p>

<p>Of special note are the first three entries. A round is approximately 12 seconds used to mark the finest period that the game tracks. At this granularity, Initiative Score is used to determine the order in which actions occur. Normally, a character can perform either one Complex or two Simple actions in a Round, in addition to Free Actions and Reactions (which take practically negligible time).</p>
<h3 id="predictable-failure"><a class="header" href="#predictable-failure">Predictable Failure</a></h3>
<p>Sometimes a character will be struggling under enough penalties that they don't have a dice pool at all. In these instances, the character is going to get zero hits, which means that absolutely nothing they do will be awesome. They can still stagger down the corridor or open a door, but as soon as a stunt requires even one hit they are going to fail unless they are a Luminary who can spend Edge on the problem to get some dice and a chance.</p>
<h3 id="team-work"><a class="header" href="#team-work">Team Work</a></h3>
<p>When more than one character throws their weight into a project they can achieve results that are more awesome and in less time than what either character could achieve alone. However, the game mechanics completely break down if you just add the dicepool of one character to another. What is done instead is that whichever character has the best dicepool is considered the main acting character, and the other characters are considered the assisting characters. Each assisting character makes their check, and each hit is added as a bonus die on the main character's test. Since characters get about 1 hit per three dice, on average improving the awesomeness of a task is &quot;hard&quot; (threshold 3). In many cases, an MC will allow a character to assist with a tangential but vaguely related skill (in which case one of the assisting characters can roll more dice than the main acting character).</p>
<p>Too many cooks spoil the broth. How many characters qualify as &quot;too many&quot; is, unfortunately, a very fluid concept that depends a lot on what you're doing. Sometimes there are real physical limits to how many people can literally fit around a project, and other times it's procedural. In general, most teamwork projects should be handled with five or fewer people. A project larger than that should probably be split into multiple tests, although at the MC's discretion there may be exceptions. A good set of management protocols is essential for most group projects to move forward. Most of the time, no more assisting characters can work on a project than the highest Tactics skill of the characters. The character providing the tactics skill allowing multiple characters to work on the project need not be the main acting character, and often will not be.</p>

<h4 id="physical-attributes"><a class="header" href="#physical-attributes">Physical Attributes</a></h4>
<ul>

<p>The primary purpose of basic attributes is to set the dicepools for actions. A character with a high Agility will have a bunch of extra dice to roll for every skill test that invokes Agility. A character with a high Charisma will have extra dice on every test that uses Charisma, and so on. A character's basic attributes represent a broad aptitude in a wide variety of actions.</p>
<h4 id="special-attributes-edge-and-potency"><a class="header" href="#special-attributes-edge-and-potency">Special Attributes: Edge and Potency</a></h4>
<p>Edge and Potency are attributes that not all characters have. Having any rating in Edge or Potency is what sets extraordinary or supernatural characters above the mortal Extras in the background.</p>
<p><strong>Edge</strong> is a measure of the extraordinary fate or narrative importance that Luminaries have. Extras have an Edge of zero, while Luminaries have an Edge of at least 1, and usually 3 or sometimes higher.</p>
<p>An important thing that Edge also does is that it adds to Resistance Rolls. Whenever an ability says that the target resists with their Strength or Willpower (or whatever) you can assume that it means &quot;plus Edge if the target is a Luminary and actually has an Edge stat&quot;, sort-of as if it were a Skill for generally resisting harm and other unwanted effects.</p>
<p>Every two points of Edge a character has increases the absolute maximum they can raise their skills to during play. While characters start with skill ratings of 6 or less, a character with an Edge of 2 or 3 can eventually raise them to 7, while a character with an Edge of 4 or 5 could raise their skills to 8. A character with an Edge of 6 can potentially get a skill of 9. Six is the maximum Edge for any character (regardless of Potency, as it is a special attribute).</p>

<p><strong>Potency</strong> When a character's powers increase they may get a special attribute called <em>Potency</em>. A character's Potency is added to the <em>maximum</em> (but not necessarily the actual value) of each of their Physical, Mental, and Social attributes, and every point of Potency increases their maximum Magic Points by 3. Normal humans have a Potency of zero. Some spawn and other weak supernatural creatures (such as Mirror Goblins) have a Potency of one. Starting supernatural creatures of a playable type such as Vampires or Witches have a Potency of 2. This rating gradually rises as the creature ages and grows in eldritch power, and can rise quite abruptly by slaying powerful elders <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091203/">Highlander</a> style, or by attuning to powerful artifacts, completing mighty rituals of vast power, or otherwise reaching the kinds of breakpoints in a story in which a monster might become nearly unstoppable. Supernatural monsters that have
attained power beyond that possible in a human lifetime are known as Elders and have a Potency of 3 or higher. The most powerful named characters in the setting (such as The King with Three Shadows or Echidna) have a Potency of 10, and player characters can expect to have a Potency much, much lower than that.</p>
<p>Potency limits the Powers that a character has access to. With potency 1 character has access to only Basic Powers. A Potency of 2 or higher grants access to Advanced powers. With a potency of 3 or more comes access to Elder powers, which would otherwise be limited to great and terrible ritual or myth. Most characters are limited to no more than one Elder power per additional point of Potency.</p>
<p>Such power has its price. Any character with a Potency of 1 or greater (and some that don't) are ruled by a Master Passion, an emotional flaw that subjects them to uncontrollable frenzy. Each additional point of Potency deepens this price by requiring a Disadvantage, starting with the Distinctive Flaw of their particular type, and from there usually developing in related but individualistic ways.</p>
<p><em>Genevra is a Vampire with Potency 2. This means that her <strong>maximum</strong> value for raising her Agility, Willpower, and other attributes is 11. 9 maximum for having started as a human, plus her Potency of 2. Her maximum Power Reserve is 13 (7 + 3*2).</em></p>

<h3 id="fluid-traits"><a class="header" href="#fluid-traits">Fluid Traits</a></h3>
<p>Rather than fixed (or at least rarely changing) ratings of a character's core competencies, Fluid Traits change frequently as they are spent or damaged and then (hopefully) recovered over the course of events in a game.</p>
<p><strong>Vitality</strong> is a measure of the character's physical capacity for damage. When a character is wounded or otherwise experiences physical trauma they mark off boxes of Vitality to represent their fading ability to cling to life (or whatever pale imitation of life they may cling to). A character's maximum Vitality is always 10. When a character has no more Vitality they will shortly be dead. Wounding and healing is covered in more detail in the Wounds, Death, and Dying section of the Danger chapter.</p>
<p><strong>Stress</strong> is a measure of the character's accumulated mental strain. When a character is subjected to traumatic or triggering experiences they accumulate points of Stress to represent their fading grip on mental and emotional stability. Stress adds to the threshold for resisting Frenzy and other breaking points. There is no maximum to Stress, but when it exceeds a character's Willpower they can no longer keep their cool and automatically succumb either to the panic condition (in the case of mortals) or go into Frenzy or Despondency (in the case of Monsters), in either case explosively burning off some of their Stress.</p>
<p><strong>Luck</strong> is a measure of the fluid benefit Edge provides until it runs out. A character's maximum Luck is equal to their Edge. You can spend it in a few ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can reroll all the dice on a test that didn't get a hit.</li>
<li>You can add a number of extra dice to a test equal to your Edge score. If penalties would reduce your normal dice pool to zero or less then you can spend an Edge to try anyway with dice equal to your Edge score.</li>
<li>You can use the Dodge or Dive For Cover actions to try to avoid an attack or other danger without using your action, or after you've already acted in a round.</li>
<li>You can stabilize while dying.</li>
<li>You can survive an otherwise lethal situation in a narratively appropriate way. At this point, you are having fate intervene to save you in a narratively plausible fashion. This will require negotiation with the MC to determine what is plausible under the circumstances, but it's more sometimes better than the previous option because it explicitly avoids someone killing you while you are incapacitated by wounds. Maybe it's the police showing up before the Trolls have the opportunity to put the boot in, maybe it's the floor collapsing and dumping your comatose character into the basement before the flames have an opportunity to burn them to death. A character being saved in such a manner will be inconvenienced in some fashion, possibly a great deal. It's intended as a last-ditch save-your-ass moment, not something to be smugly relied upon.</li>
</ul>
<p>Luck refreshes between Chapters or when you make progress on a Driving Goal. You do not have to spend Luck to get the bonus dice that Edge provides when soaking a stab wound or resisting mental domination - the extra Edge dice for Resistance Tests are automatic and free - but you can spend it to get even more dice on a Resistance Test.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4 id="luck-for-antagonists"><a class="header" href="#luck-for-antagonists">Luck for Antagonists</a></h4>
<p>There's an inherent imbalance in the way players continuously play their own characters and the way that the MC plays antagonists. The player's characters will keep being played after the current conflict, while antagonists often pass on and off the stage after a single scene. It's tempting to have Luminary antagonists burn their entire luck in that one scene while a player would hold back a reserve point or two for truly desperate circumstances that may come later. It's recommended that the MC thus only use at most one Luck per scene, unless spending it for last-ditch survival, to better portray the way that Luck is usually spent. At least, that is, until the final climatic moments of a story where all bets are off and everyone pours everything they have into the action with little or nothing held back for their own survival.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Power Reserve</strong> is a measure of the character's ability to exert themselves magically. A character's Power Reserve is measured in <em>Magic Points</em>, or <strong>MP</strong> for short, which are generally spent to activate specific supernatural abilities that a character might have. A character's Power Reserve does not automatically refresh. Characters that are supernatural creatures will not only have things to do with their Magic Points, but will also have a particular way to refresh them called their <em>Power Schedule</em>. Characters have a <strong>maximum</strong> at any given time of 7 MP plus 3 MP per point of Potency. This means that most player characters (who have a Potency of 2) will have their Power Reserve fill up at 13. Mortals and other Potency 0 creatures have a nominal Magic Point maximum of 7, but likely have no ability or reason to acquire Magic Points.</p>
<p><em>Example: Genevra is a Vampire with the Quickness ability from the Power of Celerity. As a vampire, she has the Vigor ability from the Clout discipline, and can spend Magic Points to increase her Strength for a scene. Because she is a vampire, she can refresh her Magic Points by drinking blood from other people.</em></p>
<p>There is one generic way Magic Points can be spent: you can spend Magic Points up to your Potency to add dice to any Resistance Roll against a supernatural power on a one-for-one basis.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4 id="optional-rule-burn"><a class="header" href="#optional-rule-burn">Optional Rule: Burn</a></h4>
<p>Fate and Magic Points give characters a lot of , but they are precious resources that can be used up very quickly. With this optional rule, characters can Burn permanent attributes to refresh their fluid traits, either Edge to refill luck or Potency to refill Magic Points. Characters do not naturally recover from Burn; they'll have to get those points back through Karmic Advancement or Magical Transformation. Burn is intended to allow characters to have very dramatic, powerful successes when making a long-term mechanical sacrifice is worth it for the story, but Burn is inherently unbalanced in the short term compared to the rest of After Sundown's implied metagame balance.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="using-attributes-without-skills"><a class="header" href="#using-attributes-without-skills">Using Attributes Without Skills</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;Granted, but I'm still huge.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Characters in After Sundown may be called upon to use skills when they don't actually have training in that area. In this case, the character is called upon to <em>default</em> on the skill. This allows the character to roll a dicepool of their appropriate Attribute (plus zero dice for not having the skill). When defaulting on a Social or Technical Skill, the character suffers an additional -1 die  penalty for being untrained. When using Technical Skills, that same -1 die penalty applies whenever the character doesn't have an appropriate specialization (even if they <em>do</em> have the appropriate skill). In other cases, the appropriate skill might be some sort of Background, which should generally be interpreted broadly.</p>
<p>There are a few of times when you will want to do something for which <em>no</em> skill, active or background, applies. In that case a mere attribute roll may suffice (obviously with no -1 die penalty). But remember that dice pools without skills are substantially <em>smaller</em> than dicepools with skills attached - so in most cases the MC should try to figure out a way to fit a skill in. Resistance Tests are a special case of this, since Luminaries get to add their Edge to the roll instead of a skill, and Extras are meant to be easy to affect.</p>
<h4 id="sure-things-heavy-lifting"><a class="header" href="#sure-things-heavy-lifting">Sure Things: Heavy Lifting</a></h4>
<p><em>&quot;Sure, sometimes you can do all kinds of stuff. But I can <strong>always</strong> lift a car.&quot;</em></p>
<p>There are things you don't have to roll because they simply <em>are</em>. A character with a high Charisma <em>is</em> charming, a character with a high Logic <em>is</em> smart. Even if they offend someone or fail to solve a problem, they will do so in a charming or intelligent fashion. But probably the thing you will run into most frequently as far as automatic uses of Attributes is Strength. People who have a high Strength <em>are strong</em>, and they can lift heavy things. So to help out with that, here's a table of how much a character might be able to push themselves to lift, and how much they might be able to carry home without hurting themselves.</p>

<p>And yes, things that are really strong are <em>very strong</em>. A creature with a strength of 35 can lift a <em>train</em> right off the track. Although they can only do this by lifting one car at a time and can't really walk off with it. Consider the scene in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0024216/">King Kong</a> where the giant ape (who in After Sundown would be a Kaiju) pulls a train off the tracks by lifting a car and dropping the whole thing. That's not an exaggeration, in After Sundown the giant apes can actually do those things.</p>
<h2 id="skills"><a class="header" href="#skills">Skills</a></h2>
<p><em>&quot;No one may ever know if what you did was good or bad, but you did it well.&quot;</em></p>
<p>A key portion of the die roll for any test is the <em>skill</em>. It represents <em>specific</em> training that helps a character perform a task. And because of that, it can lead to a fair amount of confusion among some people, because linguistically we refer both to people who are very good at something and also people who are good at a wide variety of things as being &quot;skilled&quot;. In After Sundown, skills are confined to the former interpretation. Jacks of All Trades are represented game mechanically by people who have relatively high <em>attributes</em> and low skills. People with high skills are specialists by definition.</p>
<h3 id="specializations"><a class="header" href="#specializations">Specializations</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;This is what I'm good at. And I'm the best. You might ask: 'what good is that'? And the answer is that being the best at anything makes you the best at something.&quot;</em></p>
<p>A specialization is a subset of a skill that a character is especially proficient in. When they make tests using the skill in a manner that is relevant to their interests, they gain 2 extra dice in their dice pool. Technical skills are an inherently specialized field, so in addition to getting 2 extra dice within a character's specialties, Technical Skill dicepools are <em>penalized</em> by 1 die if they are being used outside a relevant specialization.</p>
<p>The sample specializations are by no means comprehensive, and players should work out with their MC to find or create specializations that are right for them. A character might have their Sabotage specialized in Eco-Terrorism covering both spiking trees (that might more frequently go under &quot;traps&quot;) <em>and</em> breaking a bulldozer (that might more frequently go under &quot;Disabling Stuff&quot;). Another character might have their Animal Ken specialized in Horses, covering the training, breeding, and calming of wild and domestic horses. </p>
<p>The MC should take care to make sure that no specialization is universally useful. Specializing a skill in something that would apply in all cases is basically the same as just getting 2 points in the skill, and that's unfair. MCs must be expected to reject specializing Combat in &quot;fighting&quot; or specializing Bureaucracy in &quot;paperwork.&quot; A character can have more than one specialization in the same skill, and this is often very important for Technical skills. If more than one Specialization would apply, the character still only gets 2 bonus dice.</p>
<h2 id="physical-skills"><a class="header" href="#physical-skills">Physical Skills</a></h2>
<p>Physical skills involve doing stuff with your body. Since everyone has a body, the defaulting penalty for using physical skills untrained is zero. Without specialized training you can always still make a raw attribute test. A very strong person can grapple fairly effectively on that basis alone, an intuitive person can easily notice things, and so on and so forth.</p>
<h3 id="athletics"><a class="header" href="#athletics">Athletics</a></h3>
<p>Athletics is the skill you use to run, jump, climb, swim, throw things, and generally do everything that you're vaguely expected to do in PE except sneak into the girl's locker room and get shamed by your peers. Most stunts are athletics based, and it can even be useful in attacking enemies in combat by dint of throwing things at specific targets.</p>
<p><strong>Specializations:</strong> Climb, Jump, Run, Swim, Throwing</p>
<h3 id="combat"><a class="header" href="#combat">Combat</a></h3>
<p>Combat is the training needed to fight. Usually other people. More than any other skill, people will ask to divide up Combat into smaller fragments. It is not immediately clear why, but we strongly suggest that you do not do this. While there are truly a vast array of differences between stabbing someone with a sword and shooting them with a gun - the simple fact that the combat simulationist player can <em>name</em> them all draws attention to how simply not that different they are. The basic truths of the Combat skill include making rapid life and death decisions while avoiding threats and putting the pointy end of your weapon into the other man. There's a world of differences in possible combat situations, and that's why the skill goes all the way to six. But please remember that this is a game where flying a plane and managing a nuclear power plant can be the same skill (Operations).</p>
<p><strong>Specializations:</strong> By weapon or martial style.</p>
<h3 id="drive"><a class="header" href="#drive">Drive</a></h3>
<p>Drive allows people to drive culturally appropriate vehicles. For people in the west, that's mostly just cars. But for people in river areas or fishing communities, that's often small boats as well. Driving under safe conditions is such a banal and non-awesome thing, that characters do not need to actually make rolls to do it, so players may not even need the skill. But when it comes to dangerous driving conditions, car chases, or even just cutting commute times, rolls are generally required, and having the skill is helpful. This dichotomy is generally why in movies cars wipe out spectacularly the moment someone uses magic to create icy road conditions - a lot of people on the road are legitimately terrible drivers, and the moment things get harsh they become one of the 18,000 car accidents that happen every day in the US. </p>
<p>A character can drive a new non-standard type of vehicle for every rating point and specialization of the skill they have. Common choices are emergency vehicles, motor boats, construction equipment, armored vehicles, light aircraft, and oversized (semis and buses), but really players can pretty much go nuts. Any plane or ship which is piloted with dials and knobs rather than a wheel or stick is the domain of Operations rather than Drive.</p>
<p><strong>Specializations:</strong> Bad Weather, Aggressive Driving, Cross Town Traffic, Navigation</p>
<h3 id="larceny"><a class="header" href="#larceny">Larceny</a></h3>
<p>Characters skilled at Larceny are adept at working outside the law. It is a broad skill that covers lots of dubious activities, from identifying and bypassing security systems to picking other peoples' pockets. There is some overlap between Larceny and Rigging when dealing with locks. Locks are both geared puzzles and a basic hindrance to breaking into places. This is a good skill to have for security workers in addition to criminals. You gotta know your enemy if you're gonna win the war. </p>
<p><strong>Specializations:</strong> Concealing Goods, Legerdemain, Lockpicking, Security Systems</p>
<h3 id="perception"><a class="header" href="#perception">Perception</a></h3>
<p>Perception is the skill by which a character perceives the world around themselves. It is used to spot clues, notice subtle noises, and smell unfortunate smells. Characters with very low Perceptions are the characters who do not notice monsters sneaking up on them or have to have the meaning or import of subtle clues explained to them by other protagonists.</p>
<p><strong>Specializations:</strong> By sense, Investigation, Noticing sneaking</p>
<h3 id="stealth"><a class="header" href="#stealth">Stealth</a></h3>
<p>The Stealth skill is what one uses to avoid being noticed, either by moving quietly, becoming unseen against the background, or simply blending into the crowd. Whenever a character is being searched for, a Stealth check can be used to make that searching more difficult. Stealth involves using what is available, so there is almost no circumstance in which it cannot be used to at least postpone the moment that a character is noticed.</p>
<p><strong>Specializations:</strong> Hiding, Innocuity, Shadowing, Sneaking</p>
<h3 id="survival"><a class="header" href="#survival">Survival</a></h3>
<p>100% of the creatures alive today are the descendants of an unbroken line of ancestors who were all able to survive in their environment long enough to have had children that extends back to when single celled organisms had only two different nucleotides in their DNA. So persisting in the face of adversity is something that creatures have a birthright to. And yet, adversity has also kept up with the times. Survival is the skill of keeping up with the elements.</p>
<p>One can also make Survival checks to scavenge things of a more modern nature. A Survival check could be called for to loot useful things out of a junk yard or to track the layout of a sewer system.</p>
<p><strong>Specializations:</strong> Tracking, Gathering, Shelter, by Environment.</p>
<h2 id="social-skills"><a class="header" href="#social-skills">Social Skills</a></h2>
<p>Regular socialization is performed with Backgrounds, rather than social skills. If you want to ingratiate yourself with others, track down the word on the street, or otherwise perform social legwork, you probably want to use a background like <em>High Society</em> or <em>Barrio</em>. Social skills apply a -1 penalty to the dicepool when defaulting.</p>
<h3 id="animal-ken"><a class="header" href="#animal-ken">Animal Ken</a></h3>
<p>Dealing with inhuman beasts is a skill in and of itself. Neither lions nor sheep really have any backgrounds, and the Animal Ken skill is used in their place. Animal Ken is used to read the emotions of an animal as well as to calm one down or train it to do stuff. Animal Ken is thus your one-stop-shop for all socialization with dogs, which considering how much less a dog knows than any human or supernatural about important plot points, is not nearly as overpowered as you might think</p>
<p><strong>Specializations:</strong> Domestic Animals, Training, Wild Animals, Riding.</p>
<h3 id="bureaucracy"><a class="header" href="#bureaucracy">Bureaucracy</a></h3>
<p>Managing logistics and patiently untangling skeins of red tape is the focus of this skill. Characters can understand and manipulate laws, navigate management systems, and correctly formulate formal requests. Bureaucracy is of use whether the character is attempting to perform bureaucratic tasks and of equal utility when confronted by the implacable edifice of a Kafkaesque course. It is not unusual for people to resent bureaucracy, because it is annoying. But as anyone who has done logistics under any circumstances can tell you, <em>not</em> having rules, management, and records in place is <em>even worse</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Specializations:</strong> Business, Government, Logistics</p>
<h3 id="empathy"><a class="header" href="#empathy">Empathy</a></h3>
<p>Empathy is our primary means of interpreting the meaning of actions and inactions of other people. It is a trainable sense of how others are feeling given how they look, what they say, and what they do. Empathy is of obvious use to people like lawyers and police, but it is also an important skill for batters in baseball. It is not merely about figuring out whether someone is being truthful when they are talking, but also about determining what someone is about to do in the physical world.</p>

<h3 id="expression"><a class="header" href="#expression">Expression</a></h3>
<p>Expression is the art of entertaining and changing peoples' minds through art. Lots of people think that this can only be accomplished by making movies about gay cowboys eating pudding, but the truth is that <em>any</em> art that provokes the audience to even acknowledge it is on some level influencing the audience. Expression overlaps with Artisan to a significant extent; in general, anything that can be expressed with words falls under Expression, while anything that creates or shapes an object is Artisan.</p>
<p><strong>Specializations:</strong> Writing, Dance, Music, Oratory</p>
<h3 id="intimidation"><a class="header" href="#intimidation">Intimidation</a></h3>
<p>Intimidation is the art of using fear to get other people to believe or do things desired of them. Intimidation can be explicit (&quot;If you don't do X, I will stab you. In the face.&quot;) or implied (&quot;Did you hear that the feds caught Ted for his tax non-payment? He's going to be doing <em>time</em>.&quot;) and the threats can be to the target's person, finances, or reputation. And some of the best Intimidation is phrased in a manner that implies that some third party will do something to the target and the Intimidating character is willing to help <em>the target</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Specializations:</strong> Interrogation, Fear Mongering, Skulduggery, Blackmail</p>
<h3 id="persuasion"><a class="header" href="#persuasion">Persuasion</a></h3>
<p>Persuasion is the art of manipulating people in such a manner that it isn't immediately obvious that is what you're doing. People who are skilled at Persuasion are essentially good at <em>lying</em>, although many of them get offended if you call it that. They may prefer the term <em>acting</em> or <em>sales</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Specializations:</strong> Acting, Insinuation, Fast Talk</p>
<h3 id="tactics"><a class="header" href="#tactics">Tactics</a></h3>
<p>Tactics is the skill that governs leadership in both the military and corporate sense of the term. Characters can inspire others to give 100% or produce a battle plan. The dragon crawls on its belly, and Tactics dovetails closely with Bureaucracy in the plotting of war, whether genuine or metaphorical. The tactical aspect involves maneuvering and the orders necessary to get others to do that - in contrast to the simple appeals to rules or potentially complex logistical management of Bureaucracy.</p>
<p><strong>Specializations:</strong> Inspiration, Maneuvers, Naval, Siege</p>
<h2 id="technical-skills"><a class="header" href="#technical-skills">Technical Skills</a></h2>
<p>Technical skills apply the -1 penalty for defaulting if a character doesn't have an appropriate specialization. That is, a character may have Artisan (Painting), but they will still have to default when welding. A character who becomes trained in any Technical skill gains a specialization in that skill for free. A character can't have a specialization in a skill they don't have any ranks in.</p>
<h3 id="artisan"><a class="header" href="#artisan">Artisan</a></h3>
<p>The Artisan skill is used when you want to produce a physical object of some level of workmanship, whether you’re going for aesthetic quality or simple utility. There are a few more specializations in Artisan than in most Technical skills, in no small part because there are many materials that involve wildly different skills. It is recommended that these specializations are taken as applying to Artisan uses that are &quot;close enough&quot; - so a calligrapher might use the Painting specialization since in both cases they’re applying pigments to surfaces. Expression overlaps with Artisan to a significant extent; in general, anything that can be expressed with words falls under Expression, while anything that creates or shapes an object is Artisan</p>
<p><strong>Specializations:</strong> By Medium (Painting, Sculpture, Metalwork, Carpentry, Gunsmithing, etc.)</p>
<h3 id="electronics"><a class="header" href="#electronics">Electronics</a></h3>
<p>Electronics is the skill used to make the tools of modernity go. Everything from toasters to computers uses electronics to function. And a character with the Electronics <em>skill</em> can figure out how it functions and alter it. Digital computation has largely absorbed the mathematical skills that were required of learned people since antiquity; certain Elders have found a surprising knack for it.</p>
<p><strong>Specializations:</strong> Wiring, Software, Repair, Hacking, Cryptography</p>
<h3 id="medicine"><a class="header" href="#medicine">Medicine</a></h3>
<p>Medicine is the art of treating injury and illness to promote good health. Characters use this skill to patch injuries in their pets and team mates. It's also applicable to performing psychiatric first aid and figuring out psychological issues. Remember that the realm of horror runs on movie biology, meaning that characters who receive proper medical care are able to make impressive and full recoveries from amazing injuries.</p>
<p><strong>Specializations:</strong> Veterinary, First Aid, Surgery, Long Term Care, Psychiatric</p>
<h3 id="operations"><a class="header" href="#operations">Operations</a></h3>
<p>Operations is the skill of carrying out procedures correctly. It keeps the factory line running smoothly and processes the DNA correctly in the crime lab. It's the science of looking up exactly what to do and <em>actually</em> doing that. Generally, the key feature of Operations is that there isn't a direct one-to-one correspondence between what you're physically doing and what outcome occurs. Drive can steer a speedboat or fly a biplane, Operations can run a jumbo jet or a submarine. </p>
<p><strong>Specializations:</strong> Heavy Machinery, Evidence Processing, Lab Work, By Vehicle</p>
<h3 id="research"><a class="header" href="#research">Research</a></h3>
<p>Knowing things is important, but the fact is that your brain probably can't hold all the information you might want to have available - and doesn't always keep the things you do know readily accessible. When you need information that you don't have in your head, you can use the Research skill to go look it up.</p>
<p>Researching things overall is fairly uniform, but there are particular methods of looking things up that might not be obvious to people who don't use that system in particular. Specialization in Archives indicates an ability to look up information in data logs, newspaper histories, and other chronological information stores. The Library specialization involves looking up information in stores classified by content, and data mining covers sifting through Internet searches, wikis, and highly disorganized information for something useful.</p>
<p><strong>Specializations:</strong> Archives, Library, Data Mining, Interrogation</p>
<h3 id="rigging"><a class="header" href="#rigging">Rigging</a></h3>
<p>Rigging is the skill of MacGyvering and Rube-Goldberging things. It is the skill of practical and impromptu engineering. Including lockpicking, plumbing, and clockwork. Rigging is used for most non-electric jury-rigging as well as the creation, operation, and repair of most steampunk technologies, not to mention explosives and booby traps.</p>
<p><strong>Specializations:</strong> Fluids, Gears, Ropes and Pulleys, Explosives, Sabotage, Traps</p>
<h3 id="sabotage"><a class="header" href="#sabotage">Sabotage</a></h3>
<p>Sabotage is the art of breaking stuff in a manner which will be most effective. Sabotage can be used for &quot;rigging things to explode&quot; rather than the actual Rigging skill. Sabotage can be used to break things in such a way as to make them look not broken, to not break things in such a manner as they do look broken, and to make things break in such a manner as to explode. Remember that events in After Sundown have a pyrotechnics budget, so things tend to explode big.</p>
<p><strong>Specializations:</strong> Explosives, Disabling Stuff, Structural Weaknesses, Traps</p>
<h2 id="backgrounds"><a class="header" href="#backgrounds">Backgrounds</a></h2>
<p><em>You need to have knowledge to get knowledge.</em></p>
<p>A character's background skills can be literally anything. They represent areas of the game that a character can potentially do legwork in. That is to say that during a chronicle a character may find a clue (such as a strange shape on a video feed from outside a crime scene, a discarded heroin needle, or a tuft of fur), and background skills are methods a character could have to research that clue and gain more information. Background skills are ways for the players to transform story seeds into additional exposition.</p>
<p>Characters can personally know <em>any</em> isolated fact or individual person within the context of the story without there needing to be a notation on the character sheet or die roll involved. You don't need to have a background in evolutionary biology to know that humans are closest related to chimps of all the other great apes - you just need to be told that fact directly or indirectly by someone who <em>does</em> have such a background. But to actually evaluate the research, you need to understand the power and limitations of the methods and the kinds of results that have also been achieved.</p>
<p>Backgrounds are divided into how one interacts with them. <strong>Academic</strong> Backgrounds are ones in which the character can &quot;go look something up.&quot; They often dovetail nicely with the Research, Perception, or Bureaucracy skills. Sciences, ancient languages, classical art, and so forth make good Academic Backgrounds. <strong>Social</strong> Backgrounds are ones where the character &quot;goes to talk to some people.&quot; They often dovetail nicely with Social skills like Empathy or Persuasion. Any social group can and does represent a potential Social Background. <strong>Occult</strong> Backgrounds are ones that involve the character &quot;going to do something in secret.&quot; What skills are helpful for this kind of legwork are highly variable, because Occult Backgrounds are a very variable category. Many Occult Backgrounds are sometimes literally magical in origin (such as <em>Marduk Society Histories</em> or <em>Tarot Readings</em>), while others are simply secret for a variety of other reasons (legality, morality, or whatever). The defining point of Occult Backgrounds is that telling other people that you have them jeopardizes your ability to use them. The first rule about ghost cartels is the same as the first rule about fight club.</p>
<p>It is frequently important for purposes of socialization whether or not characters have &quot;the same&quot; background or not. Characters who have the same Background automatically have shared interests that they can talk about. However, game mechanically, Backgrounds <em>do not</em> have to have the same name to be &quot;the same.&quot; And two Backgrounds that are &quot;the same&quot; in one instance may be &quot;different&quot; in another. A Background is &quot;the same&quot; if in the current instance it covers essentially the same stuff. If one character had <em>Triads</em> and another character had <em>San Francisco Crime</em> as a Background, the two characters would be on wholly common ground when discussing San Francisco's triad operations, and would be speaking Greek or Martian to each other if the conversation changed to Hong Kong triads or San Francisco's IRA network.</p>
<p>It is up to the MC to determine what constitutes an acceptable Background for the campaign. In general, however, it is better to err on the side of Backgrounds that are too useful than ones that are too narrow. While it <em>is</em> overpowered for a character to have a Background that applies in virtually (or actually) all circumstances like &quot;Stuff&quot; or &quot;Trivia&quot;, the worst thing that's going to happen under such a circumstance is that the player is going to roleplay a lot and move the plot forward. That's not fair to the other characters (unless they are doing the same), but that's still better than the players feeling powerless and having the story stagnate.</p>
<h3 id="languages"><a class="header" href="#languages">Languages</a></h3>
<p>Languages work much like Backgrounds and can be used just like them in many cases; if you know French you can at least practice with someone else that knows French, and at higher levels you've probably read some of the same authors, watched the same shows, or listened to the same speeches, because those are the things that are used to learn languages. A single point in a language is enough to generally get by with a dictionary, the level possessed by a skilled traveler or an academic working through scholarly articles. Two points is broad fluency, and three is near-native level. A rating of 4 or more represents not only fluid proficiency but broad general exposure to the spoken and literary culture of a language.</p>
<p>Effectively, the character's effective rating in other Social skills and Backgrounds is limited by the language they converse or write in: they have all of the eloquence imparted by their Persuasion and Backgrounds with their native language, and otherwise their effective rating is limited to <em>twice</em> their rating in the language they are using, so 3 points is generally enough unless you're pushing the human limits of a skill.</p>
<p>Language Backgrounds allow the character to know that language personally. A character does not specifically need to know a language to get something translated. The ability to conjure up simple phrases such as &quot;¿Donde está el baño?&quot; or &quot;Lehněte a svlekněte se prosím.&quot; is free. Some time with an automated translation can get you a humorously inaccurate translation of many pieces of text (especially short text). And given some time, many Contacts or Intelligence Resources can translate specific languages on your behalf.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that all four major Syndicates date from before the ascent of English as the world language and knowing their prefered argot is handy. The Covenant is thoroughly wed to Ecclesiastical Latin, the World Crime League operates diplomatically in Vietnamese but also variously employs Cantonese, Mandarin, and Malay, and in their traditional homes the Makhzen tend to have a passionate commitment to languages that have been dead to the rest of the world for 2,000 years but favor Arabic for diplomacy. Even the Communes have a loyalty to French that newly created monsters find somewhat surprising.</p>
<h3 id="sample-backgrounds"><a class="header" href="#sample-backgrounds">Sample Backgrounds</a></h3>
<p><em>Trust me, I've seen stuff like this before.</em></p>
<p>The completely open-ended nature of Backgrounds can be paralyzing when it comes to actual character creation. A blank page can be filled up with <em>anything</em>, but frequently it isn't. So to help with that, here are some examples of backgrounds that some of the characters from the Persona Non Grata chapter have and some descriptions of things they use them for in their chronicles.</p>
<h3 id="social-backgrounds"><a class="header" href="#social-backgrounds">Social Backgrounds</a></h3>
<p>Support Groups: Harley did not have an easy childhood and that lead to a messy young adulthood and a lot of legally mandated treatment represented by the Support Groups Background. After hearing kids talking about an addict missing from their neighborhood, Harley's player thinks to go find the nearest church basement and check in with the group leaders to see if they know the person. After taking some time to figure out what groups the person attended (Intuition + Support Groups) she gets them to open up and break anonymity to give her some leads. When she needs a place to lay low for a while or just find new friends in a city she heads there to chat people up with Friendly Banter (Charisma + Support Groups).</p>
<p>Truckin': Jack spends a lot of time on the road and on the radio talkin' to other truckers, and this is represented by his Truckin Background. This means that he has an encyclopedic knowledge of rest stops all up and down the 101. So when he gets a time frame for when the van presumably lightened its load, he can make a very accurate guess (Logic + Truckin) about where to start looking for the bodies. When he is listening to someone's description of their journey to Walnut Creek, he notices (Intuition + Truckin) a discrepancy in their story.</p>
<p>Bar Scene: Dean goes out drinking frequently to attempt to forget the hole in his soul, and this justifies his Bar Scene Background. The team needs a decoy, so Dean goes off to the roadhouse to go pick up an extra woman for that purpose (Willpower + Bar Scene). Later on, they need to track down a fishy poker game, so he asks around (Charisma + Bar Scene).</p>
<p>Kink Scene: Mr. Eaten's main social outings are to kink events, where he can easily go by an alias and cameras are carefully limited. When looking for appropriate prey he watches how people react to scenes (Intuition + Kink Scene) to see if they might be amenable to his tastes. When moving in to converse with a likely candidate (Charisma + Kink Scene) his understanding of the customs and protocols of the scene make things go smoothly.</p>
<h3 id="academic-backgrounds"><a class="header" href="#academic-backgrounds">Academic Backgrounds</a></h3>
<p>Psychiatry: Harley was an accomplished psychiatrist before her transformation, and thus it is reasonable for her to have the Psychiatry background. After interviewing a man that witnessed a Poltergeist attack she needs to throw the police off the trail. So Marionette throws out a plausible-sounding Psychiatric explanation for the cops to eat up and spread as rumor (Willpower + Psychiatry). Later when she's trying to understand the trauma of a Wraith her (Intuition + Empathy) test has a very low Threshold.</p>
<p>Cars and Trucks: Jack knows all about things on the roads. So when it comes time to research up the DMV registration on the kidnappers' van, Jack grabs it and gets an answer for certain, because he knows that he is looking for a 2005 Charcoal Dodge Sprinter. But later on, he reaches for something to talk to the guys at Pizza Hog about, and cars seems like as good a topic as any. And since there are some other gear heads, it works out and he uses it as a Friendly Banter (Charisma + Cars and Trucks) platform.</p>
<p>Ballistics: Dean may not seem that bright, but he does know his way around firearms, and this interest is represented by his Ballistics Background. Not only can he talk for hours to gun enthusiasts about caliber and grains, but he can perform the kind of scientific forensic investigation that a ballistics expert might be called upon for. When he picks up the supposed murder weapon, he immediately notices (Intuition + Ballistics) that something is wrong because the armor-piercing bullets in the magazine should have exit wounds on the corpse. Later he measures out the probable point of origin from the bullets and gets a fix on the shooter's location (Logic + Ballistics). And when they have the specs on the enchanted rifle and Dean wants to look up what kind of weapon they are dealing with, he just does it because his Background knowledge pushes the Research threshold down to zero.</p>
<p>Fire Investigation: since he uses fire magic Mr. Eaten has been cramming information on how arsons and other fires are investigated, although he's only picked up a little so far. After using his powers to incinerate a target he tries to clean up the scene and his basic knowledge means that he has a standard threshold to cover up evidence (Logic + Sabotage).</p>
<h3 id="occult-backgrounds"><a class="header" href="#occult-backgrounds">Occult Backgrounds</a></h3>
<p>Joker Gang: Harley spent a long time as a lieutenant to a boss that terrorized Gotham which amounts to her Joker Gang background. When she needs some explosives she calls up an old friend to get them (Charisma + Joker Gang), and when reports come in of a &quot;vault heist&quot; come in she can go through the details and identify it as a feint (Logic + Joker Gang) because she knows how to break into a vault and what people are looking for in them.</p>
<p>Chinese Monsters: Jack has put up with a lot of bullshit from the Eastern wing of the Shattered Empire, and he knows his long-haired ghosts from his thundering witches. During the investigations, he meets up with The Peach Lady, and needing something to talk about, he reaches for supernatural stuff from her homeland. This is an acceptable form of Friendly Banter (Charisma + Chinese Monsters), and seemingly gets the immortal beauty to open up to him. Later on, he comes face to face with an Asian Leviathan and identifies it as such (Logic + Chinese Monsters).</p>
<p>Hell Mouths: Dean has been in and out of the Dark Reflection many times, and this is reflected in his Hell Mouths Background. As they are searching the house, Dean notices (Intuition + Hell Mouths) that the bathroom mirror has been used as a portal, and fairly recently by the ashen smell. When the team finds itself outside the Iron Tower, Dean falls on his knowledge of hellmouth locations to plan a route back to the mortal world (Logic + Hell Mouths).</p>
<p>Midwest Communes Operations: Mr. Eaten has aspirations to the Vanguard and hops on clean-up jobs with thorough professionalism. When a portal reopens outside Omaha he matches the rumors coming out to previous incursions (Intuition + Midwest Communes Operations). Later he manages to get himself invited onto the team heading out to deal with the matter by mentioning his familiarity to the Citizen organizing the mission (Charisma + Midwest Communes Operations).</p>
<h3 id="language-backgrounds"><a class="header" href="#language-backgrounds">Language Backgrounds</a></h3>
<p>Latin: it's been a while, but between Catholic school and med school Harley has a pretty decent grasp of Latin. She can make her way through the mad occult ramblings of a sorcerer she's investigating (Logic + Research) with a low threshold so long as she has a dictionary handy.</p>
<p>Cantonese: Jack's pronunciation is awful, but he's picked up a lot of street-level Chinese. He has no trouble noticing that he's getting ripped off at the gambling tables (Intuition + Empathy) by the Cantonese-speaking gamblers, but later has a bit of difficulty following the archaic dialect of the Leviathan that seems to be intent on making a meal of him (Logic + Cantonese).</p>
<p>Enochian: Dean doesn't have much of an academic background, but he's smart and had to spend a lot of time dealing with Enochian inscriptions used by the things that harass him. When coming across one of their messages he's able to puzzle it out and make some critical adjustments to his benefit (Logic + Enochian).</p>
<p>Latin: Mr. Eaten is the proud and paranoid owner of one of the few remaining copies of the <em>Umbrarum Regni Novem Portis</em>, which is printed in late Medieval Latin. He's not great, but he's supplementing high school Latin with a dog-eared dictionary and some time on Duolingo and slowly making his way through the precious grimoire. He knows just enough that he can reference his single text (Logic + Research) with no penalty to the threshold. When eavesdropping on some Covenant diplomats he manages to get the gist of their discussion with (Intuition + Latin).</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="motivations--passions"><a class="header" href="#motivations--passions">Motivations &amp; Passions</a></h2>
<p><em>&quot;We do what we must because we can.&quot;</em></p>
<p>It is important at times to realize that After Sundown is a <em>role playing game</em>, and as such that the characters being played are just <em>characters</em> and not the actual people playing the game. Even though a player will routinely use first-person pronouns to describe a character's activities (for example: &quot;<em>I</em> call the dog to <em>me</em>&quot; or &quot;<em>I</em> bend down and lick the blood off the floor&quot;) the character and the player are different people. The first person pronoun is used as a storytelling and acting device. The use of the first person pronoun helps bring immediacy and sympathy to the characters, but it doesn't actually conflate the character's unique personality traits with those of the player. Conversely, the MC will usually refer to non-player characters in the third person (for example: &quot;The knife cuts deeply into <em>Her</em>&quot; or &quot;<em>Max</em> begins to cry&quot;), and may well refer to player characters in the second person (for example: &quot;The sputtering of the lamp plunges <em>you</em> into darkness&quot;). This is done because the MC has a lot of characters they are controlling, and it is incomprehensible if all of them identify themselves as &quot;me&quot;. But regardless of what pronouns and sentence constructions are employed, the characters are <em>not</em> the same as the players. They have different abilities and a different fate. The characters can even die and it won't be the end of the world for the players. Most importantly, the characters are characters in a story, and they have different motivations from those of the players.</p>
<p>Every character in the story, like every person in real life, has personal beliefs, fears, goals, and habits that act as strings to their marionettes. In After Sundown, these motivations are formalized into Passions, Ethics, and Ideologies. And they can be of great help when determining what a character's likely responses to a situation might be. But the vagaries of circumstances are too complicated for the game rules to cover in total, and so it falls to players to adjudicate what they think their character's actions will be in response to specific events. Not only is this much more immersive and entertaining than simply deterministically generating each character's actions, but it can potentially give a more nuanced, more <em>real</em> response than any table ever could. The fact that each player presumably passes the Turing Test means that they can play a role that <em>also</em> passes the Turing Test. And that's a good thing.</p>
<p>It is unfortunately true that the game world <em>as a whole</em> includes billions of people and most of the background characters will not be given even the barest of motivational sketches. When the characters walk into a 7-11 at 2 in the morning to get Slurpees, it's not super important what the guy behind the counter is doing with his life, chances are that his lines in the play will be the barest of pleasantries and he'll get credited as &quot;7-11 Employee&quot;. But this is not always the case. Events tend to spiral out of control and develop quickly in a roleplaying game, and the players may, for whatever reason, end up conversing with the 7-11 employee for an extended amount of time, bringing his name, his ideals, and his fears to actual importance. For the MC there are two main ways to handle this fact. The first is to simply write a character on the spot, filling in details as they become important. And the second is to have some &quot;templates&quot; - a set of mundane Extras set up in advance that can be slotted into the story whenever some random person in a bank or a crowd becomes important to the story. Random name tables are incredibly useful for this, and the MC should consider getting some.</p>
<h3 id="driving-ambitions-getting-places-and-doing-things"><a class="header" href="#driving-ambitions-getting-places-and-doing-things">Driving Ambitions: Getting Places and Doing Things</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;I'm gonna do it. Just you wait and see.&quot;</em></p>
<p>While most major events in the realm of horror are soul-destroying and oppressive affairs, it is not to be ignored that there are indeed things that motivate people to <em>accomplish</em> things. And while even that silver lining must be tempered with its own dark cloud - that indeed many people in the world are motivated to accomplish despicable things - it remains a source of beauty, industry, and human achievement. Or supernatural inhuman achievement as the case may be. These motivations represent the Muse in all of us, and in After Sundown are described as a character's <em>Driving Ambition</em>.</p>
<p>Accomplishing things governed by the character's Driving Ambition means more to the character than other things. And in the grand tradition of genre fiction, meaningful accomplishments are karmically rewarded. In After Sundown, achievement in accordance with a character's Driving Ambition allows them to refresh an Edge even if it is not the end of the story. Striving to accomplish a character's Driving Ambition can bring out their very best. When a character is near to accomplishing something major with regards to their Driving Ambition and they are faced with difficulty they may - once per story - temporarily increase one of their Physical, Mental, or Social attributes (of their choice) for the duration of the scene. Sometimes it can be wise to refrain from drawing upon this inner awesomeness even when it is available because it can only be used once per story.</p>
<p>A Driving Ambition is like the narrative of the character's life as they would wish it to be. When choosing a Driving Ambition, try to think of what would make the character &quot;live happily ever after&quot; or at least end the chronicle on a positive note. They can be things like &quot;win the love of Isolde&quot; or &quot;get into Law School&quot; or whatever it is that the character's big goal is supposed to be. However, things happen and life goes on even after the love of your life has married you or moved to Cleveland with her personal trainer. Sooner or later a character's Driving Ambition becomes irrelevant. And when that happens, the character either has to go on listlessly with no real Driving Ambition or find something new to propel them forward. Protagonists rarely go long without acquiring a new Driving Ambition.</p>
<p>It is entirely acceptable for characters to have their Driving Ambitions defined reactively by the chronicle. A character might become incensed that the president had been kidnapped by ninjas or cultists were trying to destroy the world and get a Driving Ambition to put a stop to that nonsense. Most adventure stories revolve around characters doing exactly that. However, the MC should check a proposed Driving Ambition to make sure it isn't <em>stupid</em>. A character might be able to advance a goal such as &quot;eat a sandwich&quot;, but that's not appropriate in most chronicles because it is too trivial. Of course, if circumstances are such that such a goal requires genuine striving against genuine difficulties (for example: the character is stuck in Limbo and there appears to be no bread), then by all means go for it.</p>
<h3 id="ethical-taboos-a-line-in-the-sand"><a class="header" href="#ethical-taboos-a-line-in-the-sand">Ethical Taboos: A Line in the Sand</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;I'd do that for a dollar... that I would do for a hundred dollars... that I would not do.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Every person has a set of personal ethics that govern and proscribe how they behave. It is important to distinguish a person's ethics (what they will not do personally) from their ideology (what they prefer to happen). For example: many people want sewage to get treated, but very few people are willing to handle the sewage or be around sewage processing. These kinds of internal contradictions are practically universal and make for great character conflicts and growth possibilities.</p>
<p>But Ethical Taboos aren't purely debilitating, no matter what Nietzsche tells you. In a world with genuine mind control floating around, having arbitrary, even irrational lines that you won't cross can be extremely useful. After all, whatever things you don't want to do are things that you've spent much of your life figuring out how to live <em>without doing</em>, and creatures trying to puppet you around may have no idea what those are, effectively creating minefields of unexpected resistance. Game mechanically, a character whose ethical taboos are brought to the fore increases the threshold to influence them into a course of action by 1 or 2.</p>
<h4 id="princess-ethics"><a class="header" href="#princess-ethics">Princess Ethics</a></h4>
<p><em>&quot;That's horrible and I don't want to look at it.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Many people do not want to look at or participate in things that are ugly or repellent. While they probably have no moral objections to trash being collected, they have an <em>ethical</em> prohibition against doing it themselves. While perhaps not especially praiseworthy according to most ethical calculi, Princess Ethics are reasonably common. The moral of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101414/">Beauty and the Beast</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095182/">The Frog Prince</a>, and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0042332">Cinderella</a> are pretty much all that Princess Ethics are to one degree or another bad; but that should not tell you that Princess Ethics are universally thought poorly of in any society. Indeed, many societies frown on people who abandon Princess Ethics, or even <em>seem</em> to. Just the fact that &quot;Untouchables&quot; exist in many cultures should tell you how prevalent this line of thinking is.</p>
<h4 id="nonviolence-ethics"><a class="header" href="#nonviolence-ethics">Nonviolence Ethics</a></h4>
<p><em>&quot;I can't do that, people could get hurt!&quot;</em></p>
<p>Nonviolence is when <em>you</em> don't hurt or kill things by <em>your</em> actions in a direct way that <em>you</em> can see. This is very often quite a different concern from taking actions that reduce the overall amount of hurt in the world, or even reducing the amount of violence in their area or even reducing the amount of violence done on their personal behalf. For example, while a person with Nonviolence Ethics will not swing a hammer into the skull of a pig, they are often perfectly happy to eat a hotdog. A severe conflict for the follower of Nonviolence Ethics is being attacked since most people want to survive.</p>
<h4 id="politeness-ethics"><a class="header" href="#politeness-ethics">Politeness Ethics</a></h4>
<p><em>&quot;Of course I don't hate you...&quot;</em></p>
<p>Mankind, even supernatural kind continues to persist in no small part because of its ability to get along with itself. And one of the strongest forces making this possible is the capacity for politeness. Each person is expected to defer actions that might offend others. And a lot of people do this pragmatically, not wanting to potentially start shit with random strangers. And a lot of other people find this automatic restriction on their activities is truly part of their being. Insulting others or taking a dump on the table is something they <em>won't</em> do.</p>
<h4 id="privacy-ethics"><a class="header" href="#privacy-ethics">Privacy Ethics</a></h4>
<p><em>&quot;What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas.&quot;</em></p>
<p>The world's panopticon is fairly advanced, with more information collected on each person than any other person could read in a lifetime even if they could find it all in the stacks and stacks of documentation tangled up in other people's lives. And yet, a lot of people don't want to share things about themselves with others. This isn't exactly the same thing as shame, and indeed many people who feel this way are not particularly embarrassed about most of their actions, but simply feel that others knowing about them and especially <em>finding things out</em> about them is an insidious attack. Characters with Privacy Ethics won't talk about their personal life except under the most extreme duress.</p>
<h4 id="frugality-ethics"><a class="header" href="#frugality-ethics">Frugality Ethics</a></h4>
<p><em>&quot;I've got food at home. That hotdog guy is not getting my dollar.&quot;</em></p>
<p>The very nature of expending things is that once that has been done, the thing is expended. This finality is a source of genuine fear for a lot of people. The idea of not being able to use something later can be virtually paralyzing. People with Frugality Ethics are opposed to giving up things, even though by <em>never</em> using an opportunity or good it is in fact <em>very similar</em> to never having had it at all.</p>
<h4 id="hacker-ethics"><a class="header" href="#hacker-ethics">Hacker Ethics</a></h4>
<p><em>&quot;I may not like what you say, but I'd be modestly upset if someone stopped you from saying it.&quot;</em></p>
<p>People who have Hacker Ethics don't like being told to shut up and they don't like getting rid of DVDs that they haven't watched yet. In a larger sense, they feel that <em>information</em> has a life of its own and should be enabled whenever possible. Hacker Ethics provokes people to have a gut reaction of horror to censorship, even if the ideas being censored are ones they are violently opposed to.</p>
<h4 id="solidarity-ethics"><a class="header" href="#solidarity-ethics">Solidarity Ethics</a></h4>
<p><em>&quot;I don't care what he done, I ain't no snitch.&quot;</em></p>
<p>People who have Solidarity Ethics don't want to take actions that betray people. This is not the same as doing their 'duty' or holding up their ends of bargains. So for example, they would be reluctant to turn in one of their friends to the police or even tell another one of their friends that a third friend had wronged them. Passive betrayal, such as merely allowing a third party to harm an ally is not a violation. Solidarity Ethics are quite common among lower classes or persecuted minorities.</p>
<h4 id="other-taboos"><a class="header" href="#other-taboos">Other Taboos</a></h4>
<p><em>&quot;Whatever this is, I am not eating it.&quot;</em></p>
<p>There are so many possibilities for ethical taboos that they are quite likely infinite. And it is encouraged for players and MCs alike to make new and specific ethical frameworks for individual characters. Remember that ethics need not be adaptive or even &quot;good&quot;, they are simply things that characters have a mental block against doing. In the real world, some people have taboos against treating people of other ethnicities as equals or treating a woman with respect. These can appear on a character sheet as &quot;Racist Ethics&quot; or &quot;Sexist Ethics&quot; or whatever. And it is important to note that while these may be a character flaw, they are also an important facet of the character's personality. Ethics are a good way to describe the good and the bad about a character, and to flesh them out more fully as a human (or monster).</p>
<h3 id="ideology"><a class="header" href="#ideology">Ideology</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;It is everyone's goal to have things be more like the way they wish that they were.&quot;</em></p>
<p>When we use the word ideology, we naturally think of the big political, religious, and economic ideologies that have shaped the 20th century and created the world we live in. But while the demands and counter demands of Imperialism, Capitalism, Fascism, Communism, and Fundamentalism have certainly torn the world apart and put it back together in a form that would be both unrecognizable and incomprehensible to the people of even the 1800s, these kinds of big ideas are generally not supported monolithically by nations or even individuals. There are few people indeed that argue for pure fundamentalism in any real way (even the Amish make concessions to modern medicine sometimes), and when someone argues for completely pure Capitalism or Communism without intrusion by the other we call them ideologues for a reason.</p>
<p>But beyond that, the fact of the matter is that most people don't actually <em>care</em> how it is decided what plots of land will grow lettuce or how it is determined where that lettuce goes to be distributed to various kitchens and delivered ultimately to salad plates. It's not the kind of thing most people think about <em>at all</em>. So when we talk about Ideologies of characters, we are not particularly concerning ourselves with the character's personal beliefs on the extent to which the public should be invested into the oversight of and decision-making process that determines the production and distribution of agricultural products, or what form that extent of public interest should take in terms of participation and representation of individuals. We're talking about what people think <em>they</em> should be doing and even more importantly, what they think <em>other people</em> should be doing in their immediate vicinity. A character's ideology determines what actions they find praiseworthy, and what actions they condemn. Some characters think that a person going to war is praiseworthy because it is <em>brave</em>, others because it shows <em>commitment</em>, and still others because it involves <em>killing those people over there</em>. On the other hand, different people think that a person going to war is disappointing because it is <em>violent</em>, others because it implies <em>support for the current regime</em>, and still others because it involves <em>killing those people over there</em>. Every action you can take can be lauded or condemned by rational people for facets about it that are essentially identical. There is truly nothing that a man can do (including nothing) that can be universally seen as good or bad.</p>
<p>A character's Ideology should be ranked, what are the things that people could do that would most offend your character's sensibilities? What are the things that people could do that would most impress your character with that person's virtue? Note that this is the character's <em>actual</em> visceral responses, not the answers they would give to a questionnaire that others might read. Lots of people <em>say</em> they think the ten commandments are important, but how many people are in reality more offended by rape (which is not against any of the ten commandments) than by carving statues (which is)? A good start would be to write up twelve things: six things that your character would be impressed by, and six things that your character would be offended by. Note that just because a character has an ethical taboo against doing something <em>does not</em> mean that they lose respect for other people who do those things. It really can go either way. A character with Princess Ethics might be in awe of people who have the courage to squash bugs and turn to them for help. On the other hand, another character with Princess Ethics may feel that people who do gross things <em>have cooties</em> and thus not want to touch them or be near them for fear of having to think about the gross things that they do. It is entirely common for there to be contradictions available, where the character looks at the same action from two or more angles and gets different decisions on whether something should be honored or despised. For example: Eric is a pretty chivalrous guy, and likes to think of himself as an especially manly man. He's wary of people who aren't religious or who don't conform to his expectations of gender roles.</p>
<ul>
<li>Honor: bravery, confidence, pulling your weight, holding your liquor, knowing sports trivia, women who dress sexy.</li>
<li>Despise: hurting women, acting gay, renouncing Christianity, hurting people for extended periods of time, snitching to the cops, making things ugly</li>
</ul>
<p>In general, if a character is being influenced towards or by something that they honor in their ideology, the threshold to do so is reduced by one. If the character is being influenced towards or by something they despise, the threshold is increased by one. And these changes are naturally reversed if they are being influenced against or to reject things that they honor or despise.</p>
<h3 id="changing-ideologies"><a class="header" href="#changing-ideologies">Changing Ideologies</a></h3>
<p><em>That was me then, this is me now.</em></p>
<p>Ideologies do not stay static over time. Characters can be convinced through persuasive argumentation that things they thought were good were bad, or that things they thought were bad are actually good. People can be quite resistant to change, and often someone convinced that something is good will just go ahead and continue hating it <em>out of habit</em>. Even if someone agrees on an intellectual level that a group of people is in fact producing more for the economy than they are costing in civil services doesn't mean that they necessarily start liking that group of people, or even stop hating them. Indeed, prejudices run pretty deep and it is entirely frequent for a person to continue parroting arguments <em>they themselves no longer believe</em> rather than abandon ideological positions they've held onto for a long time.</p>
<p>But change <em>does</em> happen. Characters in an After Sundown game are often exposed to tremendously life-changing events, and they <em>do</em> change their lives and their goals in response to them. If you've noticed people changing their political affiliations because their son came out as a homosexual or they lost their job due to plant closings, imagine how complete the turnaround can be when a person finds themselves as a member of the living dead who drink human blood to persist from night to night.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="advantages-and-disadvantages"><a class="header" href="#advantages-and-disadvantages">Advantages and Disadvantages</a></h2>
<p><em>Oh yeah? But can you do this?</em></p>
<p>Over and above the fact that different people are stronger or weaker, more or less trained than others, there are things some characters can do that others cannot. These vary from simple &quot;stupid human tricks&quot; to feats that defy explanation even by trained stage magicians. From a game structural perspective, an Advantage is like a Power in that it is an ability that you either have or do not have. However, Advantages are available to humans, even <em>Extras</em>, and are substantially less powerful than an actual Power.</p>
<p>Similarly, some people just have problems that others don't. Disadvantages represent a wide variety of possible problems and are somewhat more integral to the game in that every playable monster has at least one of them. A character is not allowed to double-dip by using a power to eliminate the problems of having a Disadvantage; if this occurs they should choose another Disadvantage instead.</p>
<p>Characters may, with MC approval, take Disadvantages during character creation. Each Disadvantage taken will allow the player to take an additional Advantage. The inherent Disadvantages due to being a Monster or increasing Potency do not grant corresponding Advantages.</p>
<h3 id="physical-advantages"><a class="header" href="#physical-advantages">Physical Advantages</a></h3>
<p><strong>Ambidexterity:</strong> The character can use either hand without penalty.</p>
<p><strong>Double Jointed:</strong> The character can fold themselves up into ridiculous shapes and squeeze through spaces that seem... unlikely. Getting out of a pair of handcuffs isn't even a test - they can just do it.</p>
<p><strong>Extremely Competitive:</strong> If another character performs a stunt, such as in a chase or dance fight, the character gains a +2 dicepool bonus to match that stunt. The threshold to convince the character to back down, give up, or drop an issue is increased by 1.</p>
<p><strong>Fighting Finesse:</strong> The character can use their Agility instead of their Strength when attacking with unarmed attacks or Melee Weapons that they can use in one hand.</p>
<p><strong>Fists of Fury:</strong> The character's body is hardened for martial arts and their unarmed attacks do +1 damage (this does not stack with additional damage due to shapeshifting).</p>
<p><strong>Large:</strong> The character is unusually large and massive. They gain a +1 bonus to rolls to physically Intimidate others and to grab attacks (including the threshold to grab them in turn), but also will have to buy large clothing and may have difficulty finding ways to hide.</p>
<p><strong>Natural Immunity:</strong> There is some poison or disease that the character is completely immune to the harmful effects of.</p>
<p><strong>Swarming:</strong> The character is very good at fighting in groups, and does not suffer penalties for fighting in large groups and does not provide penalties to their allies.</p>
<h3 id="mental-advantages"><a class="header" href="#mental-advantages">Mental Advantages</a></h3>
<p><strong>Direction Sense:</strong> The character knows what direction things are from where they are. They know what direction they are facing and roughly how far they are from places that they have been. This can get disrupted by being moved while they are unconscious, but not by being marched around while blindfolded.</p>
<p><strong>Eidetic Memory:</strong> The character can remember things that they have seen or heard in incredibly accurate and minute detail. This means that, for example, when they see a slasher walking around dressed as a human after they the same guy dressed as a monster, they will almost invariably recognize them as one and the same.</p>
<p><strong>Experimenter:</strong> The character can quit any time. Ingesting chemicals will still eventually cause adaptation and physical dependence, but the character is never psychologically or spiritually addicted to anything.</p>
<p><strong>Mathematical Savant:</strong> The character can perform complex mental arithmetic quite rapidly and reliably, at least as fast as if they were operating a abacus, calculator, or slide rule. This extends to other pure symbol manipulation like operating a shift cipher, but that's about the limit.</p>
<p><strong>Time Sense:</strong> The character knows what time it is. They know how long it has been since the last time you asked what time it is. And they can decide ahead of time how long they will sleep - they not only do not need a clock, they don't need an <em>alarm</em> clock to manage their lives.</p>
<h3 id="social-advantages"><a class="header" href="#social-advantages">Social Advantages</a></h3>
<p><strong>Attractive:</strong> The character is sexually attractive, and it is especially easy for them to make progress through flirtation. The thresholds for convincing people who are sexually inclined towards the apparent sex and species of the character of things by these means are reduced by 1.</p>
<p><strong>Calm Heart:</strong> The character doesn't get offended by insults, even deliberate ones. This means among other things that litanies of curses do not count as a trigger for a Rage Frenzy.</p>
<p><strong>Innocence:</strong> Human society has prejudices and for whatever reason, people just don't think the character is guilty of &quot;stuff&quot;. Maybe they look small and harmless, maybe they just have an air of extreme respectability. Whatever the reason, people do not <em>want</em> to believe bad things about them. This increases the threshold to convince other people that the character has done something wrong by 1.</p>
<p><strong>Loyalty:</strong> The character really likes their friends, or maybe just takes duty to the team very seriously. The threshold to convince them to turn on those they feel loyal to (often including the other characters) is increased by 1. This even applies to magic, and the character effectively gains 1 extra hit to resist Authority and similar effects if they are being made to turn on their allies. In the case of ongoing domination such as Possession, the bonus hit can retroactively cause the character to resist the effect if they are subsequently let loose on their friends.</p>
<p><strong>One of Those Faces:</strong> The character's appearance is bland and unnoticeable, and people tend to forget their face and generally just don't notice much about them. The threshold to identify and remember distinguishing details about the character is one higher. This Advantage is not compatible with Attractive or Unattractive.</p>
<h3 id="physical-disadvantages"><a class="header" href="#physical-disadvantages">Physical Disadvantages</a></h3>
<p><strong>Allergy:</strong> The character is allergic to something reasonably common, such as mold, pollen, or cats. While in the presence of their nemesis, the character is <em>fatigued</em>. Characters weakened by alcohol or sunlight are sometimes also effectively allergic to them. Fae are usually allergic to iron, in addition to being vulnerable to it.</p>
<p><strong>Conspicuous Consumption:</strong> The character bleeds from the mouth, has weeping sores, or in some other way is <em>obviously</em> very ill. People tend to react with a mix of horror and sympathy and the threshold of getting them to feel something else - or not try to immediately get the character to a hospital - is increased by 1.</p>
<p><strong>Deadly Allergy:</strong> The character has some generally avoidable but potentially lethal allergy. If they consume the substance, whether it's peanuts, shellfish, or penicillin, it is treated as a lethal poison. Some creatures vulnerable to silver are also effectively poisoned by it.</p>
<p><strong>Distinctive Appearance:</strong> The character is easy to describe, possibly because they look wildly different from others, but maybe just because there's something really obvious like a burn mark on their face or a missing eye. Other characters get an additional 2 dice to recall details about the character's appearance and behavior.</p>
<p><strong>Oversensitive:</strong> One of the character's senses is always prone to <em>overstimulation</em>, frequently flashing lights or loud noises. This can also represent the sensitivity to bright lights of some monsters with a weakness to sunlight.</p>
<p><strong>Tunnel Vision:</strong> The character can only defend themselves in combat against one opponent at a time.</p>
<h3 id="mental-disadvantages"><a class="header" href="#mental-disadvantages">Mental Disadvantages</a></h3>
<p><strong>Aimless:</strong> The character's hopes and dreams feel distant and unreal. Advancing their Driving Ambition does not allow them to refresh an Edge.</p>
<p><strong>Anachronism:</strong> The character is from another time, or possibly just grew up in an Amish community or a savage region of one of the outlands. And they do not know how machines work unless they are specially instructed on them. The character cannot default when operating 21st-century devices.</p>
<p><strong>Compulsive Behavior:</strong> The character feels compelled to do something over and over again in ways that are maladaptive. This can be comedic, tragic, distinctive, and time-wasting. A good example of Compulsive Behavior can be found in the TV show <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FMonk_%28TV_series%29">Monk</a>. Resisting the compulsion is similar to resisting a frenzy (and may result in one if frustrated under sufficient stress).</p>
<p><strong>Delusional:</strong> The character is absolutely certain of something that does not appear to be true and will not be swayed by any evidence to the contrary. This would include most religious beliefs, but the character is not awarded Disadvantages for believing ridiculous things that are believed by a large portion of the population, because such delusions do not negatively impact the character. So if you believe that there are important messages from aliens coded in dog howls, that's a disadvantage; but if you believe that there are important messages from Jesus coded in cheese sandwiches, this is <em>not</em> a disadvantage. Not because it isn't counter-factual and immune to contrary evidence, but because society at large has accepted people with such delusions and made accommodations for them.</p>
<p><strong>Disloyal:</strong> The character would sell their grandmother for a hamburger. The threshold to get them to betray their allies (including with magic) is reduced by 1.</p>
<p><strong>Flake:</strong> The character is not particularly committed to goals or ideals, and it is easy to convince them to do other things. The threshold to convince them to follow a different course of action is reduced by one.</p>
<p><strong>Illiterate:</strong> The character cannot read.</p>
<p><strong>Prideful:</strong> The character has an extreme aversion to admitting fault. They will cling to a course of action that is obviously not working, and they will allow their sense of pride to get in the way of personal relationships. Appropriate thresholds to flattering or offending them are adjusted by one, and wounded pride may trigger a frenzy.</p>
<p><strong>Temperamental:</strong> The character is prone to outrageous emotional outbursts. The threshold to resist or end a frenzy is increased by 1.</p>
<h3 id="social-disadvantages"><a class="header" href="#social-disadvantages">Social Disadvantages</a></h3>
<p><strong>Diplomatic Incident:</strong> Something the character did, or at least something that someone <em>thinks</em> the character did causes them to be disliked by another group that they have to deal with sometimes. Increase the threshold of making a good impression on them or gaining their trust by at least one.</p>
<p><strong>Doomed Romance:</strong> Eventually you have to come to terms with the fact that the only common element in all your failed romances is you. The character's love life is a series of train wrecks. For whatever reason, the people they fall in love with turn out to be married, alien impostors, or fated to die grisly deaths.</p>
<p><strong>Eerie Presence:</strong> The character's mere presence triggers the spooky sense of normal people. This may carry over into suspicion that increases their attentiveness to the character and their actions.</p>
<p><strong>Feared by Children:</strong> Children do not like or trust the character. It's like the character is played by Alan Rickman. Increase the threshold of all social actions toward children (except scaring them) by 1.</p>
<p><strong>Minor:</strong> The character is under the critical age in their nation of origin where they are afforded the full rights and responsibilities of an adult. This may make it difficult to get into a club or get them pulled over by the cops while they are driving.</p>
<p><strong>Naive:</strong> The character is unfamiliar with modern society for whatever reason, and does not know how to respond socially to normal behavior. Increase the threshold of most social actions within such a society by 1. This does not apply to supernatural society, where the character may find they fit in much better.</p>
<p><strong>Offensive to Animals:</strong> Animals do not like the character. If a Giant Animal has a choice of targets, it will attack them, and in general, the threshold to work with animals is increased by 1.</p>
<p><strong>Oppressed Minority:</strong> The character is a member of a group that is discriminated against. Those who are particularly prejudiced may attack the character for no other reason, and the character will be faced with an increased threshold to make a good impression on many others.</p>
<p><strong>Red Taped:</strong> The character's experience with mortal government is an unending hellscape of inexplicable delays and senseless harassment. It takes forever for their driver's license to be renewed, they are regularly pulled out of line at airport screenings, and life is frustrating. In addition to &quot;random&quot; screenings, this increases the threshold of most Bureaucracy tests by one and expands their timeframe by one step.</p>
<p><strong>Unattractive:</strong> The character is physically unattractive, and the threshold to influence anyone through flirtation is increased by 1.</p>
<h3 id="supernatural-disadvantages"><a class="header" href="#supernatural-disadvantages">Supernatural Disadvantages</a></h3>
<p><strong>Blatantly Magical:</strong> There is something about the character which is very demonstrably outside the boundaries of human normality. Like possibly little wings on the back or a gaping hole in the chest where churning gears can clearly be seen. While such traits can be covered with clothing or hidden in the dark, it could be a severe problem for the Vow of Silence were such things to be seen by normal people.</p>
<p><strong>Dream Walker:</strong> The character is unusually likely to cross into Maya while dreaming. Fey creatures can sense this trait and the character will draw their attention.</p>
<p><strong>Haunted:</strong> Left to their own devices, spirits harass the character. It's entirely possible that no one knows why this is. If a Ghost has a choice of targets, it will attack them.</p>
<p><strong>Infectious Mood:</strong> The general disposition of the character is infectious. However, since they are a supernatural creature, and therefore <em>crazy</em>, the moods that they impart in others are similarly maladaptive. The character's Master Passion plays out in Extras who are in their presence for an extended time.</p>
<p><strong>Lunacy:</strong> The character's emotions wax and wane with the moon; in the week of the full moon their threshold to resist frenzy is increased by 1, and on the night of the full moon they must check for frenzy when the moon rises. Around the time of the new moon they instead have a corresponding vulnerability to despondency. Lunatic stacks with Temperamental, making Lunatic Werewolves particularly unstable.</p>
<p><strong>Mirror-Marked:</strong> The character catches glimpses of the Dark Reflection when seeing mirrors out of the corner of their eye. Goblins will target the character for abduction if given the chance.</p>
<p><strong>Pelagic:</strong> The character is strangely drawn to immersion in water. They need to soak themselves for an hour or more in at least a bathtub-sized amount every 24 hours or they begin to suffer <em>fatigue</em>.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="resources-and-obligations"><a class="header" href="#resources-and-obligations">Resources and Obligations</a></h2>
<p><em>&quot;Whoever dies with the most will presumably have the most left when they are resurrected.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Characters in the realm of horror spend more time than you might think running around naked. That's fine and all, and meshes well with a certain kind of story. But much of the time, characters really do have physical objects and social connections at their disposal in addition to their personal abilities and the contents of their mind. In After Sundown, these resources are itemized and written down in order to formalize reserves that a character can draw upon during their adventures. Individual advantages that a character has are assigned a value based on their presumptive potential utility and categorized by what kind of story advantage they grant. Resources can be physical <em>things</em>, but they can also be more ephemeral things of value such as friendships or society's recognition of ownership. Characters may also have fetters that tie their hands, demands placed upon them by society either out of need or hostility. These are called Obligations.</p>
<h3 id="resources"><a class="header" href="#resources">Resources</a></h3>
<p><em>That's what I got, what you got?</em></p>
<p>Resources are not necessarily fungible nor are they necessarily transferable. While a character's Finance Resources can usually be traded away (that being most of the point), even in those cases they may instead be stocks or property rights that may be difficult to transfer quickly and/or draw attention when title is given away at all. Friendships can almost never be sold away, and minions are not generally happy to have the subject brought up in anything but the crudest of jests.</p>
<p>Depending on the parameters of the campaign, a starting character in After Sundown is normally expected to have a 1-point Resource, a 2-point Resource, and a 3-point Resource (and no, you can't trade those all in for a 6-point Resource, but thanks for asking). With the MC's permission, a character can begin play with additional Resources, so long as they &quot;pay&quot; for these resources by taking Obligations of equal size. That is, a character might have an extra 3-point Science Resource (access to the FBI fingerprint database perhaps) but also be saddled with a 3-point Stalkers Obligation (presumably the Bureau keeping tabs on their movements). Players may not take two 1-point obligations to pay for a 2-point resource, nor may they take a 2-point Obligation to pay for two different 1-point Resources.</p>
<h4 id="backup"><a class="header" href="#backup">Backup</a></h4>
<p>Backup is people, beasts, or monsters who will fight for you in dangerous situations should the need arise. Backup becomes more useful (and thus higher rated) if they are harder core and also if you can tell them more about your situation without breaking the Vow of Silence.</p>

<p>Contacts are people who you can rely upon for information or as sources of goods. Generally speaking, any character actually knows many people, not just one. And some of them will be more &quot;useful&quot; and others less. For the purposes of the chronicle, the character's main contact is not necessarily their best friend, but likely the shadiest or best-connected person they know. One of the most important things Contacts can do for you is help you find ways to turn one kind of Resource into another.</p>

Essentially, a favor is a claim on someone else's resources or a level of effort on their part of similar value; however, you only get to call on the favor <em>once</em>, and then it's discharged. Favors are generally not transferable or fungible, and they are limited by the capabilities of the entity that owes them. For this reason, Favors uses much the same scale as Contacts.</p>
<h4 id="finances"><a class="header" href="#finances">Finances</a></h4>
<p>Finances are physical assets that a character owns or at least has access to. Finances need not be bank accounts or safe deposit boxes full of dollars or euros; they could be piles of gold or drugs or a large asset like a house or boat. A resource is financial if its primary utility is that it can be traded in the human world for goods and services, or at least is recognized as generally fungible with such if you need a loan. Indeed, the characters probably have several different things that are tradable. Rather than itemize the value of their watch and each piece of jewelry, each level of Finances gives an example of something that might be the biggest ticket item they have for trade. So a character whose largest item is their car can still probably scrape together the cash to buy some kit-kats or whatever without having to sell it.</p>

<p>Intelligence is access to special mundane methods of gaining information and solving problems. The panopticon operates blind in many areas, and the Syndicates of the world work to ensure that it stays that way. Nevertheless, the amount of information available at the hands of humans is shocking in its complexity and completeness. Someone with the right clearance could crack a lot of the world's conspiracies right open if they knew what to look for. This rightfully frightens many supernatural creatures, but having access to even small parts of the panopticon can make a character's research and investigations be much more productive.</p>

<h4 id="treasure"><a class="header" href="#treasure">Treasure</a></h4>
<p>Treasure is access to special magical methods of problem-solving. Enchanted places and objects are all over the place in the realm of horror, and many of the dark and hidden events of the past and future have been written down. Finding these places, objects, and writings of power is a serious goal for many supernatural creatures - and with good reason. Information is power, and well, <em>power</em> is power too. And when this power affects a supernatural world, it becomes useful and relevant to the interests of creatures that <em>live</em> in that world. Sometimes a source of magic will have enough gold or obvious age in it that it might be sold in a pawnshop for Euros. However, in almost all cases the market price of such items is so small in human terms compared to its utility that Witches who find out that someone sold something of true power will laugh at them.</p>

<h3 id="obligations"><a class="header" href="#obligations">Obligations</a></h3>
<p>Some characters have obligations: things that restrict their ability to act freely. Some obligations are things that the character's ethos demands of them, and others are imposed on the character from without. But the effect is really very similar. If the character's little sister is in trouble with the Glow Skulls, forcing the character to come in conflict with the voodoo gangsters; this is very similar in overall effect to a situation in which the Glow Skulls have it in for the character. While the impetus is very different, in either case, the character is drawn into conflict with the Glow Skulls &quot;against their will&quot;. And if they are captured by the Glow Skulls, it is surmisable that they will not be interrogated by Rudenko.</p>
<p>MCs should give potential obligations that players are considering for their characters the fish eye. After all, while an obligation limits the character's choices, in a very real way it limits the choices of every character in the coterie. The other characters are presumably not going to leave one of their own to take on the Glow Skulls on their own. And once they are drawn into that conflict you're saddling rest of the players with obligations that they didn't agree to or get any compensatory resources for.</p>
<h4 id="addiction"><a class="header" href="#addiction">Addiction</a></h4>
<p>Everyone has things they want to do. These are goals, and they are not Obligations. However, some people have things they <em>have</em> to do, even at a cost to themselves. These addictive behaviors can be detrimental to the successful completion of other goals. From the simple reality of giving one's self away with cigarette smoke or the glow of the ash to losing one's life savings and whole days of life to the jab of a needle. Addiction is valued by how much it impacts the character's ability to accomplish <em>other things</em>, rather than on specifically what (if anything) will happen to them if they fail to perform their addictive rituals. Note also that the value of the Addiction in game terms is not meaningfully tied to its long-term effects on the character's <em>health</em>, but merely to their ability to be goal-oriented in the context of the story.</p>

Others simply want to ruin the character's career, expose them to the media, steal their number one dime, or in some way do something bad to the character. An enemy doesn't deserve a higher rating just because they want to do something more awful to the character - they deserve a higher rating because through dedication or reach they impose a greater limit on the character's choices.

The value then of Stalkers as an obligation is determined by how many resources they will use in collecting information on the character coupled with how much the character wishes that information to not be kept.

<p><em>Scene opens on a ringing cellular phone. Camera pans back to reveal...</em></p>
<p>Characters in After Sundown run the gamut of power. Normal human extras are slaughtered in groups by monsters run amok in the fine tradition of slasher movies the world over. And yet even those monsters live in terror of even larger monsters from the ancient past. It can best be thought of in terms of regular horror movies going on simultaneously with the events from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0167190/">Hellboy</a> or <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0238546/">Queen of the Damned</a>. The Characters are created at a point just before the story starts. And thus, the point where the characters begin is dependent upon what kind of story is being told:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Origin Story:</strong> The characters begin with little or no knowledge of the supernatural as human Luminaries. Over the course of the story they discover magical powers within themselves, attain magical powers, or simply come into conflict with supernatural agents.</li>
<li><strong>The In Medias Res Adventure:</strong> The characters begin having already been supernatural creatures for some time. They have come to terms with what they are, they have made social connections amongst other supernatural creatures, and they are already members of supernatural organizations. Alternatively, they may be mortals that have successfully hunted supernatural creatures, and have extraordinary, if still mundane, abilities appropriate to that success.</li>
<li><strong>The Power Fantasy:</strong> The characters begin already powerful within the context of supernatural society. Each character is a thing to be feared, whose name is uttered in whispered tones by creatures who themselves inspire fear in mortal hearts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Regardless of what kind of story is being told, remember that it is going to be an ensemble cast with each player's character being one of the story's driving protagonists. Each character thus should have interests and goals that drive the plot forward, not just passive interests or reactive interests. It's fine for a character to be a doctor or a police officer, but they can't just be a passive observer waiting for people to get sick or cars to be reported stolen. A character worth playing thus needs to have a goal that they can work towards when there <em>isn't</em> a fire to be put out. It's fine to play a character who can heal others, but the character <em>needs</em> a hook that can get them motivated to pursue goals and advance the plot when there isn't anyone injured in their presence.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4 id="what-the-numbers-mean"><a class="header" href="#what-the-numbers-mean">What the Numbers Mean</a></h4>
<p>When you get down to brass tacks what matters is whether your character will succeed at the things they want to do. The basic estimates are:</p>
<ol>
<li>with a dice pool of three times the threshold you have a 50/50 chance of success</li>
<li>with a dice pool of four times the threshold you can buy hits to succeed automatically</li>
<li>most Extras will have a resistance pool of about 5 dice, so your practical threshold to affect them is 3</li>
<li>most Luminaries will have a resistance pool of at least 8 dice, so your practical threshold to affect them is at least 4</li>
</ol>
<p>In short, you want to have at least 8 dice in any pool you want to have basic competence in so you can reliably get 2 hits, and more like a minimum of 12 for a small number of focus areas where you want to oppose other Luminaries. Maxed-out Origin Story or In Medias Res characters can get to 15 dice with just Attributes and Skills before any magic is applied and there isn't any reason for them not to if it suits the player's conception of the character.</p>
<p>If this is the sort of thing that interests you we recommend checking out the sample <a href="2-characters/2-antagonists.html">Antagonists</a> and thinking about how your dicepools match up against theirs.</p>

<h3 id="characters-for-an-origin-story"><a class="header" href="#characters-for-an-origin-story">Characters for an Origin Story</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;Don't be silly, there's no such thing as vampires.&quot;</em></p>
<p>In an Origin Story, the characters are, or at least <em>believe themselves</em> to be mortal humans. As such, the player creates their character as if they were a mortal human Luminary. Over the course of the story, the player characters may be embraced by vampires, mauled by werewolves, or even discover that their memories of growing up in Indiana are digital imprints and they've been a robot the entire time. But becoming cursed with magic powers or discovering that they have had them all along is something that doesn't happen until after character generation. This makes characters who are substantially better than normal humans and makes sure that they have a diverse set of competencies. They <em>are</em> the Protagonists, after all.</p>
<h4 id="attributes-1"><a class="header" href="#attributes-1">Attributes</a></h4>
<p>All of a character's basic attributes start at 4. The player then prioritizes their Physical, Mental, and Social attributes, distributing 1 point to one pair, 3 points to another pair and 5 points to the last pair. Then they get 2 additional points that they can place anywhere they want. An individual attribute cannot be higher than 9 at character creation. As Luminaries characters begin the game with an Edge of 3.</p>
<h4 id="active-skills"><a class="header" href="#active-skills">Active Skills</a></h4>
<p>A character's Active Skills start at zero. The player then prioritizes their Physical, Social, and Technical skills, distributing 11 points to one set, 16 points to the next set, and 21 points to the last set. Then they get 6 points they can place anywhere they want. A skill cannot be higher than 6 at character creation. The character then chooses three skill specializations. Remember that they also gain a specialization for each Technical skill they have trained.</p>
<h4 id="backgrounds-1"><a class="header" href="#backgrounds-1">Backgrounds</a></h4>
<p>A character starts with 27 points of Backgrounds. No Background can start higher than rating 6. An important thing to note is that a character in an Origin Story has a job, some social networks and maybe a family. They almost certainly <em>don't</em> have Backgrounds like &quot;Makhzen Society&quot; or &quot;Black Spot Ethos.&quot;</p>
<h4 id="resources-1"><a class="header" href="#resources-1">Resources</a></h4>
<p>The player chooses one 3-point Resource, one 2-point Resource, and one 1-point Resource. At the MC's discretion, a player may be able to buy more Resources with Obligations. Mortal humans are not normally able to take Treasure or Secrets.</p>
<h4 id="motivations"><a class="header" href="#motivations">Motivations</a></h4>
<p>Human characters do not normally have Master Passions. However, they still do have Driving Ambitions and Ethical Taboos. So the player should define some for their character. The player should really think about what their character wants, and what their character is willing to do to get what they want.</p>
<h4 id="advantages-and-disadvantages-1"><a class="header" href="#advantages-and-disadvantages-1">Advantages and Disadvantages</a></h4>
<p>Characters can have Advantages and Disadvantages, but should have as many of one as the other.</p>
<h4 id="magical-transformation"><a class="header" href="#magical-transformation">Magical Transformation</a></h4>
<p>In an Origin Story characters have not yet become supernatural creatures. Sometimes players will want to skip the portion of body horror that goes with actually transforming into a supernatural creature. In these cases the characters can have their transformations already applied, and then tell the origin story of the characters being introduced to supernatural society.</p>

<p>In Medias Res is the storytelling technique of beginning the narration in the middle of the action. It can be exciting and engrossing, and can lead to greater audience attention, especially if the origin story is somewhat tangential to the primary events of the story. Sometimes the story will go back in flashbacks to produce the past events that led to the circumstances with which the story began like in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110912/">Pulp Fiction</a> or <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0209144/">Memento</a>, and other times the action will simply continue towards a conclusion like <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0240772/">Ocean's Eleven</a> or <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120188/">Three Kings</a>. In any case, those are all solid pieces of In Medias Res storytelling and you should watch those movies if you haven't already.</p>
<p>Characters for an In Medias Res story begin with all the introductions to supernatural society well out of the way. They are already known by and cognizant of the major Syndicates and they already have membership in a cult (if they want one) and have come to an understanding of the basic score of the horror-inspired world they live (or at least persist) in. They are supernatural creatures themselves, and have been that way for long enough that neither using their powers nor seeing others use their powers surprises them. An In Medias Res story is a good place to start for groups that want to tell stories about events <em>in</em> the realm of horror rather than ones exploring their characters' reactions <em>to</em> the realm of horror, and as such it is considered the default game.</p>
<p>Sometimes players will want to play &quot;monster hunters&quot; rather than supernatural creatures. For an In Medias Res story about Van Helsings, Watchers, and Whistlers, it is plausible to begin the story where the characters are <em>not</em> magical creatures and are instead badass human Luminaries fighting <em>against</em> the supernatural monsters of the week. In such a case the characters don't start with a supernatural type or any Powers, but they still may well have Resources and Backgrounds dealing with the occult because in an In Medias Res story the hunters have already done this sort of thing at some point in the past.</p>
<h4 id="attributes-2"><a class="header" href="#attributes-2">Attributes</a></h4>
<p>All of a character's attributes start at 4. The player then prioritizes their Physical, Mental, and Social attributes, distributing 2 points to one pair, 4 points to another pair and 5 points to the last pair. Then they get 3 additional points that they can place anywhere they want. An individual attribute cannot be higher than 7 at character creation.
Monstrous Luminaries begin the game with an Edge of 3. The character has a Potency of 2 and therefore a Power Reserve of 13.
Hunters get an Edge of 4 and an increase of two other Attributes of their choice. However, they have no Potency stat, so their attribute maximums are still 9 and they have no Power Reserve.</p>
<h4 id="active-skills-1"><a class="header" href="#active-skills-1">Active Skills</a></h4>
<p>A character's Active Skills start at zero. The player then prioritizes their Physical, Social, and Technical skills, distributing 14 points to one set, 19 points to the second set, and 24 points to the last set. Then they get 6 points they can place anywhere they want. A skill cannot be higher than 6 on character creation (or 7 for Hunters, due to their additional Edge). The character then chooses four skill specializations. Remember that they also gain a specialization for each Technical skill they have trained.</p>
<h4 id="backgrounds-2"><a class="header" href="#backgrounds-2">Backgrounds</a></h4>
<p>A character starts with 35 points of Backgrounds. No Background can start higher than rating 6. It is entirely reasonable for a character to have been out of mortal society long enough that they don't have any &quot;Corporate Culture&quot; or &quot;Service Work&quot; type Backgrounds. On the other hand, it's equally plausible for such a character to have been keeping up appearances in the mortal world (or even being involved in mortal affairs when the story begins) and thus have such Backgrounds. Mixing characters who don't know how to handle themselves in a 7-11 with streetwise modernists in the same Band can be a good roleplaying hook. In Medias Res monsters should have at least one Occult Background that represents their familiarity with supernatural society.</p>
<h4 id="resources-2"><a class="header" href="#resources-2">Resources</a></h4>
<p>The player chooses one 3-point Resource, two 2-point Resources, and one 1-point Resource. The player must take an Obligation of rating 3 or less, but they get to buy an extra Resource for taking that Obligation as normal. At the MC's discretion, a player may be able to buy more Resources with more Obligations. Some characters will have retreated entirely from the mortal world or have been out of circulation long enough as to make no difference. As such, it is entirely possible that the character has no access to Resources in &quot;mortal life&quot; at all. It's not weird for characters to begin an In Medias Res story living in a cardboard box in an alley with no job or registration in government documents.</p>
<h4 id="motivations-1"><a class="header" href="#motivations-1">Motivations</a></h4>
<p>The character in an In Medias Res story presumably has a Master Passion. If it's not the same as the default one for their supernatural type, there should be a good in-character reason for that. While they are supernatural and non-human, they should presumably still have Driving Ambitions and Ethical Taboos. So the player should define some for their character. The player should really think about what their character wants, and what their character is willing to do to get what they want.</p>
<h4 id="advantages-and-disadvantages-2"><a class="header" href="#advantages-and-disadvantages-2">Advantages and Disadvantages</a></h4>
<p>Characters can have Advantages and Disadvantages, but should have as many of one as the other.</p>
<h4 id="magical-transformation-1"><a class="header" href="#magical-transformation-1">Magical Transformation</a></h4>
<p>Characters in an In Medias Res game have been supernatural for some time and have developed some tricks that are their own in addition to having a mastery of their form and the basic powers that come with it. The character has the 6 Basic and 2 Advanced Powers common to their type, and have developed 2 Basic Power and an Advanced Power that are theirs. In addition, the character knows one Basic or Advanced Power that must be from a Universal Power or the Sorcery that their Cult (if any) specializes in. None of this applies to mortal hunters.</p>
<h4 id="place-in-the-worlds"><a class="header" href="#place-in-the-worlds">Place in the Worlds</a></h4>
<p>The character is <em>involved</em> with Supernatural Society. They already are a citizen of one Syndicate or another (this need not be the dominant Syndicate in the city the story begins in, the character could easily have spent formative years elsewhere or under the tutelage of another who was). If the player wishes their character to be a member of one Cult or another, they can simply declare that on character generation. Generally, an In Medias Res character should have a Status of 3 (Established) in either their Cult or Syndicate and 2 (Member) in the other, depending in part on their Resources and interests.</p>
<p>Mortal hunters are not likely to be members of a Syndicate, but they may be members of a Cult or antagonistic organization and are likely familiar with some information about monstrous society.</p>

<p>If you're the sort of player that doesn't enjoy the possibility of losing a character to death, then we recommend starting with the Fortitude Powers of Revive the Flesh and Restoration, which you can always get with your choice of Basic and Advanced powers as an In Medias Res character. With those you can quickly bounce back from any normal combat results, no matter how unlucky you are with dice rolls. It's still <em>possible</em> for you character to die, but it'll take something much more than just bad luck in a fight to make it stick.</p>

<h3 id="the-power-fantasy"><a class="header" href="#the-power-fantasy">The Power Fantasy</a></h3>
<p><em>I will crush you</em></p>
<p>Characters in a Power Fantasy game have the strength to throw their weight around and challenge other powerful creatures in personal conflicts. There are unfortunately no firm guidelines that can be given to what marks a good Power Fantasy Character. A chronicle where the characters are expected to ultimately square off against some wicked Ifrit may well have characters come in with a Potency of 3, while a chronicle where the characters were ultimately going to be up against The King with Three Shadows would expect characters with a Potency of 6 or even 7. Nonetheless, guidelines are provided for the former to contrast with In Media Res characters and give some indication of what powerful monstrous NPCs might look like.</p>
<p>The important consideration is that characters in a Power Fantasy game should have roughly <em>equal</em> bonuses, although it is important to note that characters in such a game will be expected to be more divergent in capabilities. The nature of the dicepool-system means that specialists in any field will roll more extra dice in their specialty than the other characters do than in an Origin Story or In Medias Res game. It can lend the air of a game of rocket launcher tag in Doom or Unreal. Which for a game where things are supposed to feel powerful is fine.</p>
<p>Monster Hunters are extremely unlikely to make it to Power Fantasy levels without having a Magical Transformation of their own, but a one-in-a-billion hunter could exist with similar guidelines if it makes sense for the Chronicle.</p>
<h4 id="attributes-3"><a class="header" href="#attributes-3">Attributes</a></h4>
<p>All of a character's attributes start at 4. The player then prioritizes their Physical, Mental, and Social attributes, distributing 3 points to one pair, 5 points to another pair and 6 points to the last pair. Power Fantasy Luminaries begin the game with an Edge of 3. Then they get 5 additional points that they can place anywhere they want, including edge. The character has a Potency of 3 and therefore a Power Reserve of 15. Attributes for Power Fantasy characters are limited to 8 (a base of 6 + Potency 2).</p>
<h4 id="active-skills-2"><a class="header" href="#active-skills-2">Active Skills</a></h4>
<p>A character's Active Skills start at zero. The player then prioritizes their Physical, Social, and Technical skills, distributing 15 points to one set, 20 points to the second set, and 24 points to the last set. Then they get 10 points they can place anywhere they want. Each skill can be as high as Edge allows. The character then chooses five skill specializations. Remember that they also gain a specialization for each Technical skill they have trained.</p>
<h4 id="backgrounds-3"><a class="header" href="#backgrounds-3">Backgrounds</a></h4>
<p>A character starts with 40 points of Backgrounds. No Background can start higher than rating 8. Power Fantasy characters may have little to do with the mortal world or approach it from a position of extreme power and should have some leeway to define their backgrounds to express their inhuman lives and abilities if they wish. In particular, they are likely to have backgrounds representing their deep familiarity with Syndicate and Cult languages, culture, operations, and laws.</p>
<h4 id="resources-3"><a class="header" href="#resources-3">Resources</a></h4>
<p>The player chooses one 4-point resource, two 3-point Resources, two 2-point Resources, and one 1-point Resource. The player must take an Obligation of rating 4 or less, but they get to buy an extra Resource for taking that Obligation as normal. At the MC's discretion, a player may be able to buy more Resources with more Obligations. Power Fantasy characters should have considerable freedom to define their Resources and Obligations.</p>
<h4 id="motivations-2"><a class="header" href="#motivations-2">Motivations</a></h4>
<p>The character in an In Medias Res story presumably has a Master Passion. If it's not the same as the default one for their supernatural type, there should be a good in-character reason for that. While they are supernatural and non-human, they should presumably still have Driving Ambitions and Ethical Taboos. So the player should define some for their character. The player should really think about what their character wants, and what their character is willing to do to get what they want.</p>
<h4 id="advantages-and-disadvantages-3"><a class="header" href="#advantages-and-disadvantages-3">Advantages and Disadvantages</a></h4>
<p>Power Fantasy characters should have a Disadvantage to match their additional Potency. They may have additional Disadvantages to match any other Advantages they may have.</p>
<h4 id="magical-transformation-2"><a class="header" href="#magical-transformation-2">Magical Transformation</a></h4>
<p>Power Fantasy characters are Elders, which means they're either quite old (a few centuries) or have stolen the power of an Elder or powerful artifact to become so powerful ahead of their time. In either case, they've essentially undergone two magical transformations and should have a backstory for each.</p>
<p>Characters in a Power Fantasy game have not only been monsters for as much as a human lifetime but have likely been pursuing additional supernatural power and mastery on a personal path for all that time. The character has the 6 Basic and 2 Advanced Powers common to their type, and have developed 5 Basic Power and 3 Advanced Powers that are theirs, which may be from any Power Group related to their monstrous type, Cult Sorcery, or any one or two other Sorcery Paths. Finally, the character has a single, signature Elder Power that they should develop with the MC.</p>
<h4 id="place-in-the-worlds-1"><a class="header" href="#place-in-the-worlds-1">Place in the Worlds</a></h4>
<p>The character is likely to be not just involved with Supernatural Society, but actively taking part in running it. They usually have Status in their Syndicate and may have formally recognized diplomatic status with others (particularly whatever Syndicate is dominant in the primary setting of the game). The character may also have substantial status within one (or more) Cults.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="character-advancement"><a class="header" href="#character-advancement">Character Advancement</a></h2>
<p>Characters in stories tend to become <em>better</em> as the story progresses. This is part of the character's heroic journey, and also serves to keep the audience interested. After all, once the protagonists have bested one problem, it is much easier to keep the listener's interest if the subsequent problems are <em>bigger</em>. Which in turn requires greater abilities on the part of the protagonists to solve. And so on. This can be seen very well in the movies Alien and Aliens. In the first film, the characters were dealing with one unknown monster and spent most of the movie trying to figure out what to do. But in the second movie, there are instead hundreds of the things, and yet the main character has already bested one in battle - the movie focuses on fighting rather than hiding most of the time. And both of those movies are very good. Indeed, Aliens 3 is one of those apocryphal movies like Highlander 2 that probably doesn't even exist. But if it did, its primary flaw would be having rolled back the progress of the second movie and thereby creating a story that the audience didn't give a crap about.</p>
<p>It is easy for advancement to get out of hand. By the time Spawn beat up the lords of each realm of existence and the creator of the universe, the story no longer held interest. A power fantasy is only interesting as long as there's still tension. While a fast rate of advancement may feel good, remember that it also advances the timeline towards the point where the game will stop being fun. It's a trade-off. Advancement that is too fast or too slow is stultifying.</p>
<h3 id="acquisitive-advancement"><a class="header" href="#acquisitive-advancement">Acquisitive Advancement</a></h3>
<p><em>In picking up a Santa-sack full of antiques, I feel that I <strong>learned</strong> that I now own a Santa-sack full of antiques.</em></p>
<p>Resources and Status as well as Obligations are gained during the course of normal play. Sometimes these are gained together: if during the course of a story a character boosts a car, they can reasonably expect to have gained a Financial Resource (the car), but may well have gained some Enemies or Stalkers as well by the same act. At other times, a character may end up with a new set of Contacts or a sack of gold totally free and clear.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, characters should use things they find over a chapter with impunity and discuss with the MC what acquisitions are going to be remembered in the next chapter or chronicle <em>at the end of the session</em>. Things that will persist into future chapters are probably worth writing down, as well as formalizing them into numerical Resource values. So if a character ends up with $100,000 in cash and some jade statues in the trunk of a car during a story it is generally worth referring to in those terms for the rest of the chapter; but when play comes to future chapters, it is better to just write it down as: Resource: Finance 2 (Cash).</p>
<p>Obligations even more so, since the character will often not be aware of newly gained Obligations and that lack of knowledge can cause well-appreciated suspense for the player. However, when the game comes to a close, these things should probably be written down (and if you rotate MCs it should <em>definitely</em> be written down).</p>
<p>Status is frequently gained in the aftermath of a story, making the accounting of it at the end of a session rather natural. However it is also true that a character can be promoted to Bishop right in the middle of the action. And that's fine. However, it is suggested that players not bother to write such career changes down on their character sheet (at least, not in <em>pen</em>) until the end of a session. As the saying goes &quot;There's many a slip 'tween the cup and the lip.&quot; and status gained quickly can also be lost quickly. A return to the status quo is perhaps nearly as likely as the retention of status until enough time has passed to be sure that no one is coming to challenge the appointment.</p>
<h3 id="transformative-advancement"><a class="header" href="#transformative-advancement">Transformative Advancement</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;There should be only me!&quot;</em></p>
<p>Transformative Advancement is when a character gains substantial amounts of power and radically changes what they can do - and even what they <em>are</em>. Major life-changing breakpoints such as this are very much a staple of the Gothic genre. Indeed, every time a Luminary becomes a vampire or lycanthrope, such a transformative juncture has been reached.</p>
<p>The precise moment when a character <em>becomes</em> supernatural is not always clear. Sure, you become a Nosferatu when another Nosferatu kills you with blood draining and passes you a Magic Point. You become a Bagheera when another Bagheera mauls you with a Terminal Wound and you spend an Edge to survive. For others it's less cut and dried. A character becomes a Fallen when their connection to humanity has been burnt out by Infernal magic, and that can take <em>time</em>. Galateans and Troglodytes often discover their non-human status only gradually, sometimes the uncovering of powers is dragged out over multiple chapters.</p>
<p>Regardless of the type of supernatural creature that the character is becoming (or discovering that they have always been), the character gains certain things when they stop being a human Luminary and start being a Supernatural Creature:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Potency of 2.</li>
<li>A Power reserve of 13 ( base 7 + (2 x 3) for Potency).</li>
<li>A Master Passion and Disadvantage appropriate to the character's transformation story.</li>
<li>The 6 Basic and 2 Advanced Powers common to their supernatural type.</li>
<li>1 additional Basic Power.</li>
<li>1 additional Advanced Power</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether these new aspects of the character are discovered gradually over several chapters or gained all at once in a flash of insight and despair, these changes are automatic and have no impact on any other sources of advancement the character may have coming. A monster's original supernatural transformation usually gives at least the following <em>immediately</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Potency of 1</li>
<li>A Power Reserve of 10 (base 7 + 3 for Potency 1)</li>
<li>A Master Passion appropriate to the character's transformation story.</li>
<li>Most of the Basic Powers common to their supernatural type</li>
<li>Any Advanced Power common to their supernatural type that is inherent to their general theme, such as Restoration for Vampires or Grotesque Aegis for Animates</li>
</ul>
<p>Monsters in After Sundown normally gain Potency and learn Elder Powers only very slowly. Many Elders only have a single Elder Ability for each century or three of their persistence - or even less. The King with Three Shadows has a Potency of 10, indicating that his Potency gain per century averages out to like ¼ or so. In the default After Sundown chronicle, we can expect the number of centuries to pass to be some number very close to zero. Getting Elder Powers and increasing Potency the &quot;honest&quot; way is simply not going to happen. Characters in After Sundown <em>can</em> gain these powers over a story, but only by grabbing hold of asymmetric power of some sort.</p>
<p>The destruction of powerful elders gives off a flash of power that empowers those present or leaves dark fluid which will empower those who drink it or some similar rite of power theft that is generally available to several characters at once. Siphoning the power out of an elder is generally frowned upon by supernaturals (even in the Cauchemar Communes) and is called &quot;Titaning&quot; (or by snarkier members of supernatural society that don't care for Chronos references: &quot;Quickening&quot;). Having taken down an Ifrit and gained Potency well before one's time is a fast way to gain respect as well as power - but it also causes many members of supernatural society to regard the characters as dangerous loose cannons no matter what their reason for the battle was.</p>
<p>Similarly, powerful artifacts can be Titanized under certain circumstances, and various tomes and places of power exist that can imbue a character with Elder Powers that would normally take them decades to master. However, it is important to note that characters are not normally going to be &quot;entitled&quot; to gain Potency or learn Elder Powers over the course of the stories. They come as rewards for completing especially difficult chronicles or defeating particularly powerful antagonists.</p>
<h3 id="karmic-advancement"><a class="header" href="#karmic-advancement">Karmic Advancement</a></h3>
<p><em>What goes around will have gone around.</em></p>
<p>At the conclusion of chapters, characters may advance <em>personally</em> in addition advancing their cause. Advancement of this sort is difficult to plan ahead of time. No one really knows what lessons they will learn from the future and supernatural creatures don't always get to decide ahead of time what powers they will develop or when they will do so. And so when a chapter ends and the players are ready to do the accounting at the conclusion the MC may deal out cards for players to bid on. They bid with karma tokens. Tokens are gained by the following means:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each player may have one or more karma tokens banked from the previous chapter. Any tokens that are not spent are banked automatically.</li>
<li>Every chapter, each player gains two tokens that they can bid for themselves.</li>
<li>Every chapter, each player has another token that they can nominate <em>another</em> player to get when they do something awesome. What constitutes something awesome enough to warrant getting a karma token depends upon the style of game being run</li>
</ul>
<p>When it comes time for bidding, the MC deals out a number of Tarot cards and one of the players can choose one to begin bidding on by bidding one or more tokens for it. Then it is auctioned off, with each player in turn being offered the opportunity to bid more tokens or pass. When everyone has passed, the player with the highest bid spends that many tokens and adjusts their character sheet as dictated by the card gained. Then the player to the left of the one who got the last card nominates another available card by bidding on it or passes the opportunity to the player to <em>their</em> left. This continues until all cards have been sold, none of the players wish to bid on any remaining cards, or no one has any more tokens (no card can be &quot;sold&quot; for less than 1 token).</p>
<p>Ideal karma tokens should be physical objects of sufficient mass to be effectively slid across the table from one player to another, without being big enough to be unwieldy or heavy enough to accidentally hurt people. Poker chips and glass beads are good bets.</p>

<h4 id="dealing"><a class="header" href="#dealing">Dealing</a></h4>
<p>There are several different methods for determining advancement deals. Generally speaking, a relatively consistent system should be used throughout a chronicle and a campaign. Remember that a Major Arcana is worth roughly 3-5 times what a Minor Arcana card is. Bidding is <em>very</em> different when players are spending the same tokens on a +1 to Research and a +1 Logic in the same auction than when they are evaluating only one or the other.</p>
<p><strong>Commensurate Achievement:</strong> In this system the MC determines whether they think that a major milestone was passed in the current chapter or not, and accordingly deals out a number of cards that are pre-selected to be either Minor or Major Arcana exclusively. The deck is simply divided and cards from only one type are dealt. For a major milestone, it is recommended to deal two Major Arcana plus as many Minor Arcana as there are players. For a minor chapter, only the Minor Arcana might be dealt.</p>
<p><strong>Minimum Awards:</strong> In this system, the MC determines how many Major Arcana the last chapter was worth (usually 1 or 2) and then deals out cards from the combined deck until that many Major Arcana appear. There may be many Minor Arcana on the table or none at all. And as such, the number of cards to be potentially bid on may be very much higher or lower than the number of players.</p>
<p><strong>Minimum Coverage:</strong> In this system, the MC determines ahead of time how many <em>cards</em> the chapter was worth (usually 1 or 2 more than the number of players), and deals out that many cards from the combined deck. There may be several Major Arcana showing or none at all.</p>

<h4 id="deterministic-karmic-advancement"><a class="header" href="#deterministic-karmic-advancement">Deterministic Karmic Advancement</a></h4>
<p>The random nature of advancing character traits from Tarot draws helps to give characters a more interesting and organic path of development, but some people just really hate it. If you want to do have a more traditional &quot;point-buy&quot; system of advancement here are our basic recommendations:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th style="text-align: left">Advancement</th><th style="text-align: center">Cost</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td style="text-align: left">Active Skill Point</td><td style="text-align: center">2</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align: left">Background Point</td><td style="text-align: center">1</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align: left">New Advantage</td><td style="text-align: center">3</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align: left">Attribute Point</td><td style="text-align: center">6</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align: left">Basic Power</td><td style="text-align: center">5</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align: left">Advanced Power</td><td style="text-align: center">7</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>We specifically want to recommend that you do <em>not</em> scale these costs further according to how many points a character already has in a given trait; while this makes some intuitive sense it tends to lock-in characters to their initial competencies and discourages further specialization and encourages mix-maxed character creation.</p>

<h4 id="a-dracula"><a class="header" href="#a-dracula">A Dracula</a></h4>
<p>Start with a Strigoi Vampire. For your sample starting powers go with a mix of Call of the Wild powers (Beast Form to turn into a wolf or bat, Tongue of Beasts and the Beckoning to command wolves, rats, and bats) and Clout powers like War Form and Monstrous self to turn into a brutal killing machine. Or grab an Authority power to build off of Mesmerism.</p>
<h4 id="a-lost-boy-vampire"><a class="header" href="#a-lost-boy-vampire">A Lost Boy Vampire</a></h4>
<p>Camazotz are suited to this and they can already fly and be stylish. Look into Veil of Morpheus powers, especially Phantasmagoria, to round out your bag of tricks. The Attractive Advantage works great with this type of role.</p>
<h4 id="an-interviewable-vampire"><a class="header" href="#an-interviewable-vampire">An Interviewable Vampire</a></h4>
<p>Strigoi for this one. You're easily able to add Authority and Discernment powers for mind reading and control (Mesmerism and Telepathy work very well together), and you can grab fun one-offs like Clinging or Flight to round out the power set.</p>
<h4 id="a-buffy-vampire"><a class="header" href="#a-buffy-vampire">A Buffy Vampire</a></h4>
<p>Nosferatu all the way. Just activate War Form whenever you vamp-out, and you're already good to go.</p>
<h4 id="mr-hyde--the-hulk"><a class="header" href="#mr-hyde--the-hulk">Mr. Hyde / The Hulk</a></h4>
<p>Icarid is a great choice for this; just pick up War Form and/or Monstrous self to represent your killing machine self, and maybe grab Revive the Flesh and/or Restoration to become unkillable.</p>
<h4 id="the-invisible-man"><a class="header" href="#the-invisible-man">The Invisible Man</a></h4>
<p>Icarid again. This time go with the Play of Shadows powers Shadow Casting and Cloak of Shadows. Maybe ask the MC if you can take the later as a <em>Mutation</em>.</p>
<h4 id="a-cat-person"><a class="header" href="#a-cat-person">A Cat Person</a></h4>
<p>This can go more than one way. Scary killer cat people go Bagheera. You can also just be any kind of Witch and pick up Beast Form from Call of the Wild as a starting power.</p>
<h4 id="the-mummy"><a class="header" href="#the-mummy">The Mummy</a></h4>
<p>There's no one official way to be a movie mummy. Khaibit can pull it off very easily; just grab Conspicuous Consumption as a Disadvantage and dip into Fortitude for Patience of the Mountains and Restoration - you're officially immortal now. Authority powers like Mesmerism and Cloud Memory play into the shtick as well. Baali and Mekhashim work nearly as well.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can go with a Revenant and add any magic you find appropriate.</p>
<h4 id="a-golem"><a class="header" href="#a-golem">A Golem</a></h4>
<p>Robots make great Golems out of the box, just choose the artificial body variant and specify that your Grotesque Aegis means you're made of clay. Spark of Knowledge works well as a Discipline for Golems to represent a relationship with the written word. If you like you can work with your MC to specify that your character's power ritual involves repeating the words that power them instead of the more usual electrical power.</p>
<h4 id="nancy-from-the-craft"><a class="header" href="#nancy-from-the-craft">Nancy from The Craft</a></h4>
<p>Nancy could easily be in either the Baali or Mekhashfim traditions, but the later probably works a little better. Call of the Wild, Veil of Morpheus, Guise, and Clout (for Telekinesis) are great choices.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="scenes--systems"><a class="header" href="#scenes--systems">Scenes &amp; Systems</a></h1>
<p>There are many types of stories that can be told through After Sundown, including perhaps somethings that would be barely recognized as coherent stories at all. And while there is a broad limit to the sorts that these rules can allow, even within that there are various choices of focus that need to be made. </p>
<h2 id="flow-control--storytelling-techniques"><a class="header" href="#flow-control--storytelling-techniques">Flow Control &amp; Storytelling Techniques</a></h2>
<p>While the game may proceed at any timescale, from tracking every combat round to passing years with little notice, most of the time action is divided into <em>Scenes</em>, which are more abstract. Roughly speaking, a scene is a narrative measure of time that takes place in a single location and concerns one principle activity. There's no strict limit, but generally scenes should be a few hours at most and certainly less than a full day.</p>
<p>Player characters will often primarily be interested in when scenes are cut because some of their powers will end or need to be refreshed when they start a new scene. But from the MC's perspective, the most important thing is when to cut away from one level of detail to another. It's not necessary to have everything occur in a scene; it's acceptable to just provide some narration to bridge into the next interesting thing.</p>
<p>Similarly, <em>Chapters</em> are a larger unit of narrative time, covering a single Mission or other major action that has it's own rise and fall. Chapters generally take several gaming sessions over a dozen hours to resolve, and are important because they represent when characters get Karmic Advancement. Each Chapter should have its own larger scope of rising and resolving action, although as with scenes there's no requirement that the player characters be successful by the end of the chapter.</p>
<h3 id="setting-the-scene"><a class="header" href="#setting-the-scene">Setting the Scene</a></h3>
<p>New scenes often start by framing the location  - an <em>establishing shot</em> - followed by the most critical details about <em>who</em> and <em>what</em> (<em>mise en scéne</em>) is present in that location. The goal here is to present the maximum amount of thematic and useful (to the players) content with a minimum of words and time. Two or three tight sentences is about what you get, which is not much. Try to start with open-ended hooks that give broad strokes and let the players direct attention themselves to dig further into the details you've teased. For instance, you can mention a bar, but save the description of the furniture, drinks, and staff until the players ask about or move towards the bar specifically. Similarly, by using recurring locations you have the ability to build up and riff on those details over time.</p>
<p>A good way to economize on lists and descriptions is with recurring <em>motifs</em> that represent both the thematic content of the game and something interactive for the players to do things with. Don't just have a group of characters that appear unrelated, but give them a consistent look and behavior. Use similar imagery and recurring classes of objects, like particular types of food, drinks, furniture, and decoration. Think of the set dressing in the <em>Matrix</em>, which combines deteriorating buildings, antique furniture, and strange technological apparatus. This gives us a combination of technothriller and noir moods, while the particulars of the buildings and technology are important to the characters' strategies (like escaping through a wet wall that is open between floors). When players have a background of awareness of the sorts of impromptu resources their characters have available to them it helps them to creatively intertwine their character's actions into the world.</p>

<p><em>&quot;You never see anything anyway. They always, uh, turn the camera, and... play music and... y'know, the wind blows and then the curtain moves. You don't see anything.&quot;</em></p>
<p>When the action of the scene goes into territory that your group doesn't want to examine in detail - for any reason - you can manage the implicit inclusion of that action by setting up the implication of what the action will be and cutting away before the action occurs, which is usually called a &quot;fade to black&quot; from the literal technique of reducing the brightness to produce a fully dark screen.</p>
<p>While this can be used to avoid disturbing content, it's important to note that it can also draw attention to it. A great example of this is in the 1931 Frankenstein, in which the monster was originally shown to throw a little girl into a river in a misunderstanding of the game they were playing. When censors cut the scene just a bit earlier it resulted in the following discovery of her death implying a much darker possible version of the scene in the audience's imagination. Similarly, the MC can sometimes create terror and horror most easily by having the action occur just out of the character's ability to perceive it, or by having them encounter the results of the actions without witnessing them.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="montages"><a class="header" href="#montages">Montages</a></h2>
<p><em>20 minutes later...</em></p>
<p>Montages are used for situations where the relevant action takes place over a time period that is longer than is interesting. They are therefore a concern primarily of <em>pacing</em>. If the action would take more time at the table to resolve than it is worth for how important or interesting it is, use a montage. If the it is interesting, important, or just plain <em>short</em> enough skip the montage and roleplay out the activities and dialogue. For the purposes of powers and other matters of timing, a given montage that occurs in a single day counts as a single scene.</p>
<p>The difficulty Threshold of a Montage is based on how difficult it is to get a piece of information or item by the route you are attempting in the montage. So for example, the Threshold to find out what gang wears purple bandanas is going to be pretty low (1 or 2) if you're asking a bunch of hooligans at  SK8R |, and it's going to be pretty high (3 or 4) if you are asking around the country club. In most cases, a montage will take place with a brief description of the endeavor by the player with possibly some interjection by the MC, followed by rolling dice and subsequently the MC divulging what is learned and/or gained. Roleplaying the consequences should usually begin from that point, having at least a small scene played out in full before jumping into another montage.</p>
<h3 id="formal-request-montage"><a class="header" href="#formal-request-montage">Formal Request Montage</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;Be sure to attach your TPS form to the front of that.&quot;</em></p>
<p>When a character wants to get something out of an organization it can seriously take a long time. A lot of forms may need to be filled out, appointments made, plans explicated, needs justified, and who knows what all else. This can be done as a montage, the potentially vast stretches of time between one form submission and the next appointment can be wiped away with literal screen wipes, possibly cutting to the exasperated faces of the characters or a time/date subtitle. But for all the time involved, the legal systems of mortal government or supernatural Syndicates both are incredibly useful sources of information, resources, and action. In the case that the story is <em>about</em> navigating through bureaucracy (perhaps you are redoing <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118826/">The Castle</a>), it is probably better to handle these situations as a series of interviews that are tied together with Bureaucracy checks.</p>
<p>Dicepools of these kinds of requests are usually Logic + Bureaucracy. Organizations are usually limited in what they are capable of delivering through these methods. It's also very useful at times to use a Formal Request as an entrance requirement to a scene that will be roleplayed in more detail. For example, the military won't just <em>give</em> you old school flame throwers, but you can get yourself a closed-door meeting with an inventory officer who you could attempt to persuade or coerce into arranging for the goods to be delivered.  A formal request is likely to be poorly received if the character delivering it is not familiar with the topic or organization. If someone lacks an appropriate background, raise the threshold by a point or two.</p>
<h3 id="burglary-montage"><a class="header" href="#burglary-montage">Burglary Montage</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;I would like to triangle button a car.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Civilization in general, and big cities especially, are full of stuff that people &quot;own&quot;. And we use quotation marks around that concept because there's generally no magical markings on objects that tie them to their recognized owner. The recognition of ownership part of society and the social contract. People are only able to put things down with the expectation that those objects will still be there waiting for them in the future because promises of retribution have been made on each person's behalf by the nation. And you know what? Most of that doesn't apply when the city is being invaded by alien plants or you happen to be a monster who doesn't give a rat's ass anyway. Very often a player will be in the situation of wanting to use some property that is defined as belonging to someone else. In this case, it's often useful to just have the character come from offscreen with the appropriate object that has been taken from a home, car, or storefront.</p>
<p>Dicepools for these kinds of theft are usually Agility + Larceny. You can't use a Montage to steal stuff that isn't nearby. And if it isn't just sort of &quot;around&quot; but available only in specific limited quantity possessed by people who matter to the story, then you should probably play it out as an action scene. So while a character can go &quot;hotwire a car&quot; offscreen, it's usually inappropriate for a character to steal &quot;Fangorz's Bentley&quot; without devoting genuine story scenes to the action of finding it, breaking in, and hotwiring it up. It is also worth noting that going off and stealing shit is almost by definition &quot;illegal&quot; and that may matter depending upon where you are.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the difficulty of stealing crap is based on how difficult it is to get to the stuff, <em>not</em> on how valuable that stuff is. For example, stealing blankets is difficult because they are inside locked houses with people sleeping on them, while stealing cars is comparatively easy (at least if you aren't after the expensive cars that people keep in guarded locked facilities) because people park their cars <em>outside</em> and in <em>plain view</em>. It's also important to note that just because you stole something fair and square doesn't mean that the universe or anyone in it now recognizes your ownership of it.</p>
<h3 id="social-interaction-montages"><a class="header" href="#social-interaction-montages">Social Interaction Montages</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;Honestly, I just want the rifle. I don't really care who it comes from.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Sometimes the character is going to be doing some combination of skulduggery and schmoozing, but the direction of the story doesn't call for a scene to be extensively roleplayed. This is often the case in a situation where many NPCs are going to need to be talked to, the actual effects of the scene are relatively minor, and/or negotiations involved will simply take a long time. Players and MCs alike can be inclined to &quot;get on with it&quot; rather than haggling through the location and procurement of an unlicensed firearm or finding a gang member who has seen the Red Ghost. In these cases it is often best to just skip to the montage and roll dice.</p>
<p>Dicepools of these kinds of requests are usually Charisma + Background. Even propelled by narrative imperative as they are, the player characters are not going to be able to get information or objects that do not exist. None of the ruffians at the pool hall have a magic sword or know the true name of the Mask of Envy. They just... don't.</p>
<h3 id="research-montage"><a class="header" href="#research-montage">Research Montage</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;Is the world ending? I have to research a paper on Bosnia for tomorrow, but if the world's ending, I'm not gonna bother.&quot;</em></p>
<p>It is often important for a character to go look something up. This may simply be sufficiently arcane, convoluted, or obscure that even experts have to look it up, or it may be something that the character simply does not happen to know. A montage of this sort will generally appear as just a few frames of a computer screen reflected in the character's glasses or even skip to the character walking out with a relevant book open to the correct page.</p>
<p>Dicepools of this type of request are usually Logic + Research. A character's Background skills are vital in these types of requests, and their relevant Background is subtracted directly from the threshold. Someone with a strong background in physics is never going to <em>fail</em> to look up the mass gravitational constant even though they probably have to look it up in the first place. Remember also that just because you have the background knowledge and the research chops needed to hone in on the information you want, it doesn't follow that the information you want is available. A local library may well have the genealogical data needed to show that Old Man Withers is an immortal, but it probably doesn't have any book anywhere in it that will tell you how to get to the Oaken Abyss or the Eye of Despair.</p>
<h3 id="crafting-montage"><a class="header" href="#crafting-montage">Crafting Montage</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;Hey, we do what we do best. We improvise, all right?&quot;</em></p>
<p>Characters sometimes want to create new things. Often these are things that are not readily available for various reasons of legality or demand, such as silver bullets and improvised explosives. A montage of this sort looks like a series of dynamic camera cuts that show us impressive tools and materials and inevitably finish with someone polishing or blowing the dust off the finished product. Of course, getting access to the tools and materials might be an important story to be played out in its own right, or a simple matter of a Burglary Montage to break into a house or veterinary clinic.</p>
<p>Dicepools for making things are usually Logic + Artisan or Logic + Rigging, but other attributes and skills might be applicable, such as Medicine or Operations. Since crafting usually involves Technical skills Specialties are pretty important to effectiveness.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="interviewing-people"><a class="header" href="#interviewing-people">Interviewing People</a></h2>
<p><em>&quot;One does not just walk into Mictlan, Mr. Anderson.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Characters are going to be in situations where they are talking to NPCs. It's most of the game when you consider devoted table time. In many cases, the interaction with the NPCs can be mostly freeform roleplaying because what you're <em>mostly</em> after is exploring the personality of the character and elucidating their connections to the people around them. But there come times when your character will want to get specific information or assistance from the NPC that they are talking to. And because After Sundown <em>is</em> a game, it falls here to roll some dice. What dice a character rolls depends largely on what they are doing and what role they are playing in the conversation. The Threshold depends upon how much the NPC in question wants to give it to you. If the NPC wants to give it to you, such as trying to buy drugs from a drug dealer or trying to get information about someone who has wronged them recently, is not especially difficult (Threshold 1). If the NPC wants to keep it to themselves, for example, the information might get them in trouble, it very much is (Threshold 3 or higher).</p>
<h3 id="friendly-banter"><a class="header" href="#friendly-banter">Friendly Banter</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;You wouldn't happen to know where I could score some meth, do you?&quot;</em></p>
<p>When you are in a regular social situation, you can just ask people stuff without having it get all weird. On the plus side, people just tell you stuff and there is no chance of being &quot;found out&quot; and you didn't step on anyone's feelings. Of course, if someone is asking for something that the person doesn't approve of, that lack of approval may well get transferred to the asking character. And of course, blunt questions can be easily overheard.</p>
<p>Dicepools of these kinds of questions are usually Charisma + Background. You can only use a Background that is appropriate to the situation and shared by the target. Friendly Banter can also be used to just plain <em>make friends</em>, and is invaluable in that respect. Other ways of getting information out of people are likely to leave a trail of hurt feelings or outright enemies, but Friendly Banter usually leaves people with a positive impression of you.</p>
<h3 id="interrogation"><a class="header" href="#interrogation">Interrogation</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;Where were you on the night of the 29th?&quot;</em></p>
<p>Sometimes a character is in a situation where they have a fair amount of power over the NPC and can ask the really rude questions. In these situations, the character can indeed do that. This is no more likely to get a coherent, accurate, or helpful answer than doing it in some round-about-polite manner, but it is generally <em>short</em>. Also, if you ask someone a simple question it is generally much easier to see if someone is evading it than if you ask a complex one.</p>
<p>Dicepools of these kinds of questions are usually Logic + Intimidate. Even if you don't get the success you needed to get the NPC to spill the beans, you can derive substantial information from the questions that they didn't answer or gave vague/contradictory answers to. If asked about something that the NPC is trying to keep secret and the character's number of hits is insufficient by 1 or 2 they will become alerted that the NPC is specifically holding out on them. If the character lacks familiarity with the relevant subject, it becomes easier for information to be withheld, and they only become alerted to deception if the test falls short by 1.</p>
<h3 id="subterfuge"><a class="header" href="#subterfuge">Subterfuge</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;That's fascinating. How did the boss respond to that?&quot;</em></p>
<p>It is often the case that the thing a character is looking for is, for one reason or another, not something that they wish to give away. If a character is engaged in conversation and attempting to lead it to the revelation of key secrets or whatever, they may attempt subterfuge. The character drops hints like a trail of breadcrumbs, and <em>ideally</em>, the target responds by crawling along to the conversation's destination and makes the big reveal. This only works if for some reason the other person is voluntarily talking already. Normally this is because the character and the target share some Background and are having an actual conversation about something inane while the subterfuge is taking place. But in some cases, there can be an otherwise unconnected business deal going on. For example, if a character is opening an account at a bank, the manager pretty much has to talk to them even if they share no interests whatsoever.</p>
<p>Dicepools of these kinds of questions are usually Charisma + Persuasion. Subterfuge lays a verbal minefield for the user as well as the target, and the character may give themselves away. The target is entitled to an Intuition + Empathy test. If they get more hits than the manipulating character got on their test - they will catch on to the fact that they are being played. Whether they care or not (and how they respond if they do), depends entirely on circumstances. But having the discussion terminated is a pretty common reaction.</p>
<h3 id="testing-the-waters"><a class="header" href="#testing-the-waters">Testing the Waters</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;Some people were pretty excited last night, any idea what that was about?&quot;</em></p>
<p>For reconnaissance, it is sometimes merely important to find out <em>if</em> someone knows about something rather than specifically what they know. This can be especially true if the character already knows a piece of information and merely wants to know how far the information has spread. In any case, when the character is trying to passively identify who knows about a subject without literally broaching it, the character is said to be Testing the Waters.</p>
<p>Dicepools of these kinds of questions are usually Intuition + Empathy. The primary disadvantage of Testing the Waters is that it doesn't usually give you the answers you are looking for - it just tells you who <em>has</em> those answers. On the plus side, if you do it professionally (Threshold 2) you don't give away what you were looking for, and if you do it crazy extremely (Threshold 4), people don't even realize you were inquiring about anything.</p>
<h3 id="impersonation"><a class="header" href="#impersonation">Impersonation</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;Getting in is easy. Getting it done is hard.&quot;</em></p>
<p>In the old days, pictures were hard to come by of even the most important people. With the advent of the digital camera and internet pornography that is no longer true. Nevertheless, there exist a number of ways in After Sundown to appear to be a different person in a way that will pass even the most thorough visual inspections.</p>
<p>Dicepools of these kinds of questions are either Charisma + Persuasion or Willpower + Persuasion, depending upon the character's chosen demeanor. Impersonation is opposed by the target's Intuition + Empathy. If the target has an appropriate Background skill and the character does not, the target can add their Background skill to their test. Only a target who has some reason to know what the impersonating character should be behaving like gets to make a test at all. If a character disguises themselves as former Australian Prime Minister John Howard, a group of American or Asian targets will probably get no test to pierce the impersonation, because they have no idea what kind of mannerisms or opinions the real John Howard has.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="tradecraft"><a class="header" href="#tradecraft">Tradecraft</a></h2>
<p><em>&quot;Over the course of two months he's called home from six different pay phones, from two different cities, never using the same phone twice. And when his mother asked him where he was, he lied. He said that he was in a place in the country with bad cell reception—implying he was in the Tribals—but he was in Peshawar. I'm sorry, but that's not normal guy behavior. That's tradecraft.&quot; —Agent Maya, Zero Dark Thirty (2012)</em></p>
<p>The vast majority of actual intelligence work is, like all investigation, actually just sorting through information and talking to people. For that the <a href="3-scenes-and-systems/2-montages.html">Montages</a> and <a href="3-scenes-and-systems/3-interviews.html">Interviews</a> sections have you covered; tradecraft is the sexy part of spying that takes place in the field.</p>
<p>Above tiny Bands that usually meet in person and have deeply personal bonds of loyalty the institutions of monstrous society - the Cults and Syndicates - are explicitly secret conspiracies that are trying to hide their very existence from the rest of the world. Essentially this means that living with them - or working against them - is in part much the same sorts of activity that the espionage community engages in, and thus many of the same techniques and skills - collectively referred to as <em>tradecraft</em> - are required. In a sense, the Vow of Silence is about maintaining good <em>operational security</em> regarding everything supernatural; it's just that we don't recognize some of that security as such because monsters have the option of using literal magic instead of mortal means. But if you're the one fighting the monsters it's all the more important that you keep everything as secret and secure as you can, because those conspiracies will try every trick in the book to stop you.</p>
<h3 id="secret-communication"><a class="header" href="#secret-communication">Secret Communication</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;How long do you want these messages to remain secret?&quot;<br />
&quot;I want them to remain secret for as long as men are capable of evil.&quot;<br />
― Neal Stephenson, Cryptonomicon</em></p>
<p>Practically every way that you might want to talk to someone at a distance is heavily monitored by dozens of intelligence agencies. Finding things out is largely a matter of having access; unencrypted communications are available to people with the right Intelligence Resources; sorting through the vast amount of information available - if you don't already have a name or number to check - would be a test of Logic + Research or Logic + Electronics. Using encryption for every communication is the most basic opsec.</p>
<p>You should be using encryption. The one problem with using encryption to keep your secrets is that computers are too good at it; you can't keep up with the kind of cryptanalysis a computer can do without using a computer yourself, and then you've saddled yourself with whatever security flaws that computer has (and they always have some). While there is comparatively little risk to ordering packages online, anything that needs to be absolutely secret - like the fact that can beat a ghost to extra-death with a baseball bat or that you stole state secrets - can't fully trust most encryption to be totally secure. Any attempt to keep a message secure comes down to a resisted roll of Logic + Electronics (with a Specialization like &quot;Security&quot; or &quot;Hacking&quot;) if anyone has access to a system along the chain of computers involved.</p>
<p>One-time-pads are the exception: you sit down and flip a coin or whatever until you've filled up a page with as many bits as your expected message. You send a copy with whoever you want to talk to later, and when a message needs to be sent you use the sheet as your cipher, then burn it. So long as you never lose it or reuse it there is absolutely nothing that can be done with cryptanalysis to break the code. The logistics of using a one-time-pad are almost completely hopeless; however, as you need to produce a lot of pad for any substantial amount of message, know you need it in advance, and then keep both copies secure both before and after they are used. Employing the pad without error would be a test of Logic + Operations with a threshold of 1.</p>
<p>Book ciphers are another option. Messages are hidden as references to particular line or word in a commonly published book that both Alice and Bob have access to, classically the Bible, which has so many editions and translations that the third word of the 15th line on the 100th page could be practically anything. So long as the individual references are varied enough and the messages are short enough it's hard for frequency analysis to figure out the message. Groups like the Daziban can use incredibly obscure works in their book ciphers.</p>
<p>Class pre-software ciphers stop casual eavesdropping, but anyone with the basic digital tools can break them with a Logic + Electronics test against a threshold of 1; they just can't stand up to digital cryptanalysis with a modern computer.</p>
<h4 id="coded-language"><a class="header" href="#coded-language">Coded Language</a></h4>
<p>Instead of ciphers, most low-tech operations use coded language: they employ normal speech except for a few key words or phrases that have a secret meaning, hiding the significance and meaning of their conversation in plain sight. Code names are a prime example; just call your target &quot;the hawk&quot; and no one will know exactly who you're hunting. Codes like this are still vulnerable to analysis, but so long as you keep them simple enough to do in your head you don't have to worry about computer security holes leaking your secrets.</p>
<p>Characters could also just share an entire language that is a secret to everyone else. The oldest Makhzen courts have the advantage that no one else speaks their languages anymore. No one will figure out what you're saying in Linear A unless they have some way to crack a translation into another language. The language doesn't even have to be secret; Navajo worked pretty well in World War II. In general, having a shared secret language requires the characters to all have at least one point in a Language background.</p>

<p><em>&quot;The world would be a safer place if people didn't do dangerous things.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Action sequences are generally split into 12-second combat rounds. That's five combat rounds in a minute. This means that in the inestimable &quot;side scroller&quot; fight in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0364569/">Old Boy</a>, that the fight goes on for 3 rounds before Dae-su Oh spends a round pretending to be unconscious before he goes at it again. The fight between Spiderman and Green Goblin goes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Round 1: Green Goblin throws Peter through a wall</li>
<li>Round 2: Green Goblin throws a bomb through the hole in the wall</li>
<li>Round 3: Green Goblin taunts Peter</li>
<li>Round 4: Green Goblin and Peter exchange punches</li>
</ul>
<p>Considering how many dice get rolled, such flurries of action can already take a fair amount of time to resolve, so breaking the time down finer than that is generally not worth doing. When the action gets to even slower parts like cross-city chases and boat maneuvers, we pull out of combat time altogether.</p>
<p>Remember that while it is theoretically possible to let loose astounding numbers of bullets in just a second or two, in actual combats it's entirely likely that any particular 12 seconds will go by with no shots at all. Fog of war takes quite a while to roll out.</p>
<h2 id="actions-and-reactions"><a class="header" href="#actions-and-reactions">Actions and Reactions</a></h2>
<p>Normally a character may take one Complex Action or two Simple Actions during their turn. A character may do some relatively large number of Free Actions, and like Complex and Simple Actions, all of these are done during the character's turn. Reactions and Movement are done while it is not a character's turn. Interruptions are rare in After Sundown, and normally an action is fully resolved before the next action is declared.</p>
<h2 id="initiative-order"><a class="header" href="#initiative-order">Initiative Order</a></h2>
<p><em>&quot;Then I attack, then you attack twice, then I attack, then you attack once?&quot;</em></p>
<p>At the beginning of a Combat Round, every player rolls Intuition + Agility. The number of hits is their Initiative Score. Characters act in order of Initiative Scores, and characters whose scores are the same act simultaneously. A character who gets a higher Initiative Score may choose to act <em>after</em> characters with a lower Initiative Score if they want. Each character gets one turn.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="moving-evading-and-escaping"><a class="header" href="#moving-evading-and-escaping">Moving, Evading, and Escaping</a></h2>
<p><em>&quot;There are places I want to be, places I want to see, far away from here, nowhere that is near.&quot;</em></p>
<p>The second most defining action in combat (after attacking) is people endeavoring to not be part of the combat. And while that often involves <em>hiding</em> the other possibility is <em>running</em>. 12 seconds is a long time in a dangerous situation, and characters can move quite substantial distances in those periods. It's long enough for someone who is very good at that sort of thing to run a hundred meters and then change the magazine on an M-16 (seriously). But if you watch horror movies (or even documentaries, not that they are better source material for After Sundown), you'll note that people spend many 12 second periods without covering that much ground. In part, this is because the high end of speeds that people are capable of frequently take a fair amount of time to get started, and partly this is because running off at full speed without knowing where you are going is often suicidal.</p>

</tbody></table>
<p>In general, a character declares their intention to move before any actions are taken, and characters can take their actions as if they or their targets were where they were at any point during the turn. 12 seconds is a long time, so if someone is moving around a corner or into view it is reasonable that some number of bullets went towards them while they were in the open. For exceptions to this, see Taking One For the Team and Diving For Cover. Often it won't matter, but characters with the lowest Initiative Score declare their movement first.</p>
<h4 id="movement-penalties"><a class="header" href="#movement-penalties">Movement Penalties</a></h4>
<p>Doing anything precision based while moving faster than a Careful Walk is actually pretty difficult. On most actions, characters receive a -2 penalty for an Ordinary Walk, a -3 penalty for a Rapid Jog, a -4 penalty for an Exhausting Run, and a -6 penalty for a Draining Sprint. Most people can't do much of anything while sprinting. Close Combat is actually something of an exception, in that momentum is also helpful, so characters receive no penalty for a Rapid Jog or Exhausting Run to their melee attacks.</p>
<h4 id="going-faster"><a class="header" href="#going-faster">Going Faster</a></h4>
<p>If a character is just concentrating on moving, which is to say that they spend a Complex Action on moving fast, they may make a Strength + Agility test to increase their speed by 10% per hit. And yes, this means that a character who gets 6 hits can sprint at nearly 50 KPH (30MPH). That's very fast, but it's also a lot of hits.</p>
<h3 id="escaping-from-harm"><a class="header" href="#escaping-from-harm">Escaping from Harm</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;Slashers know shortcuts.&quot;</em></p>
<h4 id="disengaging"><a class="header" href="#disengaging">Disengaging</a></h4>
<p>A character can move out of close combat just as they can move into close combat. However, turning your back on a lunatic with a meat cleaver is <em>dangerous</em>. To represent this, a character moving out of Adjacent range with an opponent is not only treated as being adjacent with that opponent for the rest of the round, they are no longer actively resisting, so the threshold to hit them is just <em>zero</em> (modified of course by circumstances such as visibility and dodging).</p>
<h4 id="taking-one-for-the-team"><a class="header" href="#taking-one-for-the-team">Taking One for the Team</a></h4>
<p>If a character disengages from close combat, <em>another</em> character still engaged in close combat with the same opponent can choose to throw themselves into harm's way. This redirects a parting attack to the brave character playing bodyguard (or sacrificial lamb). The threshold to strike the new target is unchanged.</p>
<h4 id="dodging"><a class="header" href="#dodging">Dodging</a></h4>
<p>If a character is aware of attacks being made against them, they can attempt to move out of the way of those attacks. Heck, even if they don't know where the attacks might come from, they can still move erratically and hopefully throw off potential attacks. Dodging is a Complex Action that is not penalized for any movement short of a full Sprint. The character makes an Agility + Combat or Agility + Athletics test, the character increases the threshold to hit them with attacks they are aware of by 1 less than their number of hits, and increases the threshold against even attacks they cannot predict by 2 less than their number of hits. The defensive benefits of the Dodge last for one round.</p>
<h4 id="diving-for-cover"><a class="header" href="#diving-for-cover">Diving For Cover</a></h4>
<p>With special urgency, a character can attempt to get behind something solid <em>before</em> they get hit with bullets or shrapnel. The character makes an Agility + Athletics or Agility + Stealth check, and if they get more hits than the initiative count of their attackers, they get behind cover before the attacks are resolved. Diving for Cover can be announced out of turn, and uses up a Simple Action. Diving for Cover is not penalized for movement speeds at all.</p>
<h4 id="untangling"><a class="header" href="#untangling">Untangling</a></h4>
<p>If a character is trapped in a net, a set of handcuffs, or the grip of a monster they can attempt to escape by untangling themselves. This is generally a Complex Action. The character makes a Strength + Larceny or Agility + Larceny test, and if they succeed they have escaped. Untangling can't be tried an unlimited number of times. If the character tries and fails to escape, they are stuck until they get help or the next longer timeframe passes. The threshold to escape a net is generally 2, the threshold to escape a set of handcuffs is generally 3. The threshold to escape a character having abducted them is equal to the number of hits the abductor achieved when grabbing them in the first place.</p>
<h3 id="chases"><a class="header" href="#chases">Chases</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;Man vs. horse races are interesting. The man wins the six-second sprint and the three-day ultramarathon and loses everything in between.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Normally in After Sundown we don't keep track of where each character exactly is at any precise point in a 12 second period. Twelve seconds is not long enough to decide that someone isn't going to answer the phone or go to the bathroom or anything, but in terms of climbing stairs or running around a room in a house it's a fairly long time, and we can assume that people are getting shots off opportunistically. However, it is also true that it is very frequently desirable to model one character running <em>away</em> from another. In that case, the simultaneity of the two characters moving makes the granularity of the turn sequence problematic.</p>
<h4 id="short-chases"><a class="header" href="#short-chases">Short Chases</a></h4>
<p>During a single combat round, it is often important to know whether a character can get away from another in time to not get struck in the back with a meat cleaver. When combat is occurring and one character is attempting to get away from another, a Short Chase may be called for. If the chasing character wins initiative, they catch the target. If the chasing character is moving faster, they catch the target. If neither of those things are true, the target gets away. If the character who would be losing the chase is unhappy with this result (as they may well be), they may attempt Stunt of some level of awesomeness to change their defeat into victory. Most Stunts are Agility + Athletics, although depending on the terrain Agility + Stealth based Stunts may also work. A chase stunt uses a Simple Action. If the stunt is successful, the other character is then forced to lose the chase or replicate the stunt with a similar level of awesomeness; if the stunt is unsuccessful they are caught, and if it misses its mark by more than one hit the character also falls down or wipes out. If the chasing character attempts to duplicate the stunt and they get the same number of hits, they still win the chase but also must use a Simple Action doing it. If they get more hits than required, they use only a Free Action and still win the chase. If the target of the chase gets away, the chasing character can elect to let them go or go on to a Long Chase.</p>
<h4 id="long-chases"><a class="header" href="#long-chases">Long Chases</a></h4>
<p>When characters are performing parkour across the city or driving across town the chase can drag on for quite a while. There are concrete examples of chases that have gone on for hours or days. Even a relatively fast-paced and action-packed sequence like the pulse-pounding muscle car expo up and down the hills of San Francisco in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062765/">Bullit</a> takes ten minutes or so and is quite tedious to attempt to replicate in 12-second combat rounds (48 die rolls <em>each?</em> No thanks).</p>
<p>A Long Chase is conducted in turns of arbitrary length. That is to say, the game does not specify how long it is between stunts as cars continue to roll down the street or people race across rooftops. Honestly, it's hard to even tell, because most of this will get edited out of the movie anyway. What happens is that each round the chased character has the option of performing a Stunt. If they do so, the pursuer must attempt a stunt of equal challenge, or the fleeing character escapes. If the retreating character declines to do a stunt to try to get away, the pursuing character can perform a stunt to catch up. If the stunt succeeds, the chased character has to match the stunt or be caught.</p>
<p>When a character in a long chase performs a Stunt, they can choose any level of awesomeness they want from the Pedestrian &quot;weaving through traffic&quot; (threshold 1) to the Extreme &quot;pulling a U-turn through the grass to run the other way on a frontage road&quot; (threshold 4) to the Super Human &quot;flipping the car over the median and driving off the onramp through oncoming traffic&quot; (threshold 6). If they fail their stunt, then they wipe out and are no longer involved in the chase. If both characters succeed at the stunt, then the lead grows if the quarry got more net hits, and it shrinks if the pursuer gets more net hits. If neither character gets more hits, the chase continues. If neither character commits to a stunt, then the lead grows if the quarry is physically moving faster and shrinks if the chasing character is.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Caught:</strong> If the chasing character narrows the lead below a narrow lead they have caught up to the chased character. This may not be the end of the chase, as it merely means that the chasing and chased characters are close enough to affect each other directly. The pursuing character may have limited options if they are both in vehicles (though they take the opportunity to perform a PIT maneuver if they were confident in their driving skills and didn't mind replacing the front end of their car). Once the quarry has been caught there is at least one round to perform close-range maneuvers, but if they take their action to attempt to escape again it can go directly back to a Long Chase.</li>
<li><strong>Narrow Lead:</strong> Most Chases begin at a narrow lead. The pursuing character can perceive the chased character or vehicle with ease. If the target turns or performs a stunt, the pursuing character can see that happen. At this range, the stunts are normally Strength or Agility + Athletics on foot or Intuition + Driving in a car.</li>
<li><strong>Wide Lead:</strong> If the chased character widens their lead then their path is not always visible to their pursuer, and they can plausibly make an unwitnessed turn and throw their pursuer entirely. At this range, stunts are usually performed with Intuition + Stealth, but may be done with other attribute/skill combinations if the circumstances warrant.</li>

<h4 id="hide-and-seek"><a class="header" href="#hide-and-seek">Hide and Seek</a></h4>
<p>People cower under stairs and hide in closets from approaching slashers in horror movies all the time, and sometimes this even works. When you grab yourself a hiding place, you are putting yourself in a position where anyone who looks hard enough for you <em>will</em> find you. There are only so many places for a person to be hiding in the basement, so if the man in the hockey mask or the reanimated Nazis spend long enough searching that basement, they <em>will</em> find any person hiding there, and it will go poorly for someone. The gamble with hiding is that in fact, ax-wielding psychopaths are busy people and they have shit to do. So if they search the basement for some amount of time without finding anyone, they'll give up and try the garage. The way this works is that the seeker announces how long they are going to look in an area and makes an Intuition + Perception test. The hider makes an Intuition + Stealth test to determine how long the base time to find them would be, and that time is divided by the hits on the Seeker's Perception test to determine how long it would actually take them to find the hiding character. If they do spend enough time looking, the hiding place is uncovered, and if they don't, they don't.</p>
<p>The base amount of time needed to search an area depends on how large it is and how much stuff there is in it. It is important to note that it is entirely intentional that people who are more with-it and stealthy are harder to find even if they are huddling in the same place. That is how it works in the horror genre. Note also that if more than one character is hiding together, that the character with the <em>best</em> Stealth check gets to set the threshold to find them. In the horror genre, it is importantly true that masked men find you <em>faster</em> when you split up and hide separately than when you stay together. The hide and seek table assumes that the seeker is looking in the right place. If the hider is in the closet but the seeker doesn't know that, they may be searching the whole house.</p>

<p>The table assumes that the seeker is looking for something human-sized. Very small things can be very difficult to find and can have longer base hide-and-seek times with similar hiding places. Finding an unsorted book in a library or a literal needle in a haystack could easily take all day. Characters who are hiding can also panic and run (or sneak) from cover if they think that the seeker is dedicated enough. This goes to Chases, though the option often exists to make a Stealth stunt to sneak out while the seeker has their attention elsewhere.</p>
<h3 id="driving-like-a-maniac"><a class="header" href="#driving-like-a-maniac">Driving like a Maniac</a></h3>
<p>Even if you're driving a clunker of a VW Bus from the 1960s that goes 0-60 in 12 seconds, you <em>still</em> hit 60 in the first round. During that round, your clunky car will have cleared more than 160 meters, and the next round it will go more than twice that distance. Any car that is already moving is practically unreachable by pedestrians unless they have super speed or are already ahead of the vehicle and willing to do an extreme (or even crazy extreme) stunt to get one chance at jumping on like an action cop. Cars start in a variable amount of time, but you may have to turn the key several times to start even a well-oiled machine if you're panicking or the plot requires it. What this means is that if a vehicle hasn't started already at the beginning of the round, it won't start until every character who is moving to the car's location has done so had the opportunity to act.</p>
<p>Vehicles have a convenient system on them called a speedometer which tells you how many kilometers per hour they are traveling, and the conversion rate to meters per round is three and a third meters per round per KPH (or 5.36 meters per MPH if your speedometer reads in Imperial). As such, even a modest town speed will move a car more than a normal person makes with a Sprint. Generally speaking, speed limits are there for a reason, which is that if you go more than 10 KPH faster than that, things become <em>unsafe</em>. If you're driving at safe speeds, driving is &quot;not awesome&quot; and generally threshold 0. Characters who are culturally familiar with cars do not need to make Driving tests under those circumstances. However, if characters drive at unsafe speeds or in really terrible conditions, tests need to be made. This is why characters in movies will often say that they &quot;can't go out in this storm&quot; even when there is a monster loose in town, because if they don't have a Driving Skill they literally can't.</p>
<p>As a general rule of thumb, driving over 10 KPH faster than the safe speed is has a threshold of 1, 20 KPH faster has a threshold of 2, 40 KPH faster has a threshold of 3, 80 KPH faster has a threshold of 4, and so on. Safe speeds are generally marked on roads. Poor visibility and hazardous driving conditions reduce the safe speed, as mentioned in the driver's manual you theoretically had to read to get a driver's license. Terrible conditions may reduce the safe speed to zero. A character needs to make one driving test between each &quot;place&quot; which is a rather fluid concept of topology. Routes that have more important locations on them to potentially crash or break down at require more rolls. Because it's narrative driving, and that's seriously how it works. People sometimes blow a tire in the middle of nowhere, but no one ever loses a tire in the east of nowhere.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="attacking"><a class="header" href="#attacking">Attacking</a></h2>
<p><em>&quot;This is going to hurt you more than me.&quot;</em></p>
<p>The most common actions in combat are attacking and running away. After all, if <em>someone</em> isn't doing one of those things, it can hardly even be considered combat.</p>
<p>An attack is usually resolved by spending a Simple Action to make the Attack. The character makes a test against the threshold. If the requisite number of hits is achieved, the attack succeeds and the target must soak the amount of damage that the attack inflicts. If the attacking character gets <em>more</em> hits than necessary, the net hits are added to the damage of the attack before the target gets to soak. In most cases, a character's dice pool will be their Strength + Combat when making a melee attack and Agility + Combat when making a ranged attack. In the cases when an attack is being made with some kind of sorcery, the dicepool may well be something else entirely and is described in the power's description.</p>
<p>When a character wants to attack something it is more difficult if the target is farther away. The <em>range</em> between the target and the attacking character determines the base threshold. However, just because a character has the <em>accuracy</em> to strike an opponent out to a specific range does not mean that their weapon is physically capable of reaching that far, or of reaching a target at that range with any accuracy. Most weapons have a maximum range beyond which they cannot be expected to work, and most weapons have a range beyond which they become inaccurate (given in parentheses). Melee attacks of course simply have an absolute limit of their reach. If you want them to go any farther than your arm will take them you have to throw them.</p>

<p><strong>*</strong> The Threshold to hit something Adjacent to you is <em>zero</em>. Seriously, it's right next to you. However, if the target is a resisting creature that is aware of the impending attack, the threshold is increased to half the target's Agility + Combat (if any, round up). Yes, against skilled opposition it is <em>much</em> easier to shoot an opponent from 3 meters, where they can't interfere with the shot, than it is to shoot them from within arm's reach where they can.</p>
<p>The Threshold can be further modified by circumstances.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the target has cover or its location is suspect (as in the case of illusions or intervening shower curtains), the threshold is increased by 1 or 2.</li>
<li>If you're operating beyond the accurate range of your weapon (but still within the maximum range), increase the threshold by 1.</li>
<li>If the target is moving quickly (such as from Celerity), increase the threshold by 1.</li>
<li>The penalty from the attacker's movement pace</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="complications"><a class="header" href="#complications">Complications</a></h3>
<h4 id="multiple-attackers"><a class="header" href="#multiple-attackers">Multiple Attackers</a></h4>
<p>Multiple attackers are only specifically advantageous when the attacking characters are in Close Combat. A victim can only actively resist as many enemies as they have actual Combat Skill points. If there are more attackers than that, the target is going to have to allow a certain number of enemies to get free attacks on them. On the other hand, working together with additional attackers <em>also</em> requires training. An attacker who is attempting to deliver a group beat-down suffers a -1 penalty to their attack roll for each additional attacker beyond their actual Combat Skill. It is thus entirely reasonable for potential attackers to simply wait outside a beating rather than get in the way.</p>
<h4 id="supine-and-prone-enemies"><a class="header" href="#supine-and-prone-enemies">Supine and Prone Enemies</a></h4>
<p>When a target maintains a low profile by getting on the ground, it is hard to hit them with ranged weaponry - increasing the threshold to hit them by 1 if they are at any range beyond <strong>C</strong>lose. On the other hand, hitting Adjacent enemies who are on the ground is easy, and characters get an extra 2 dice to do that.</p>
<h3 id="special-attack-actions"><a class="header" href="#special-attack-actions">Special Attack Actions</a></h3>
<h4 id="aim"><a class="header" href="#aim">Aim</a></h4>
<p>Aiming is the act of taking extra time with a shot to make it more accurate. Each Aiming action reduces the effective range between the character and the target by one range category for the next shot. The actual distance does not change, and the threshold is still modified upward if the character is firing from beyond the weapon's accurate range. If the weapon is sufficiently braced that recoil is completely negated and the target does not move substantially from its original position, the character's Aiming can continue to apply on future shots. The first Aim action takes a Simple Action, and each further Aim action takes a progressively longer time frame (1 Round, 1 Minute, 5 Minutes, and finally 20 minutes of preparation to reduce a Remote target to be effectively Adjacent). These subsequent Aim actions all apply to the same attack, but a character can't benefit from more subsequent Aim actions than they have actual skill rating in Combat or Rigging. Aiming at targets beyond Long range requires a scope.</p>
<h4 id="going-all-out"><a class="header" href="#going-all-out">Going All-Out</a></h4>
<p>If a character doesn't care about the danger to themselves they can make an all-out effort to hurt someone and apply a +1 bonus to their melee attack dicepool, but the threshold to make attacks against them at Adjacent range becomes 0.</p>
<h4 id="touch--counting-coup"><a class="header" href="#touch--counting-coup">Touch / Counting Coup</a></h4>
<p>If all you want to do is touch someone, the pool is the same as a normal melee attack.</p>
<h4 id="eating-people"><a class="header" href="#eating-people">Eating People</a></h4>
<p>While human jaws aren't well suited to biting onto resisting targets the way that a wolf's jaw is, you can certainly try. A bite attack is at +1 threshold, unless you're engaged in a grapple with the target or have a big projecting mouth or fangs. If a biting attacker is much larger than the target - like say a Kaiju and a human - they can not only scoop them up like a grab, but swallow them whole.</p>
<h4 id="charging"><a class="header" href="#charging">Charging</a></h4>
<p>If a character is rapidly moving towards their target when they strike it adds additional force to the blow. If a character deliberately charges at a target at a jogging or running pace they take no penalty to their action and add +1 to the damage to represent the extra force of the blow. However, the target can also take advantage of this velocity by planting a spear or other long weapon to impale the attacker with the force of their movement - such a defender resolves their attack first and also gains +1 to damage. Character's that have superhuman speed to their movement, whether from Celerity or a motorcycle - may do even more damage at the MC's discretion.</p>
<h4 id="suppressive-fire"><a class="header" href="#suppressive-fire">Suppressive Fire</a></h4>
<p>Suppressive Fire is the act of firing a bunch of bullets near a piece of cover that a target (or targets) are hiding behind. Since Suppressive Fire is fired at a place where the targets are not, it has no chance of hitting them. What it <em>can</em> do is seriously threaten anyone who breaks cover. If during the following round any potential target comes out of cover (even for purposes of popping out to take a better shot), they are subject to an attack as if they had no cover at all. Suppressive Fire is very effective game mechanically with automatic weaponry because autofire has improvements in accuracy but suffers penalties against targets in cover. This is not an accident, as suppressive fire is frequently and effectively used in the real world with weapons that have a high rate of fire. Suppressive Fire is a Complex Action and covers the entire round.</p>
<h4 id="spray-n-pray"><a class="header" href="#spray-n-pray">Spray-n-Pray</a></h4>
<p>Automatic weaponry can be walked across areas, firing off bullets seemingly at random. This is neither advisable nor safe, but it <em>can</em> hit people with bullets and kill them. Which for people with little skill with firearms is not necessarily a bad deal. Spray-n-Pray differs substantially from most actions in After Sundown because the character's Skills and Attributes aren't used. Instead, the character nominates an arc and rolls just 6 dice total (you can think of this as having a virtual minimal Agility of 3 and the 3 dice for autofire) against each potential target in the area. Spray-n-Pray ignores threshold modifiers from target speed or poor visibility, but is otherwise a normal ranged attack. Spray-n-Pray is not compatible with Aiming, and thus it will likely not hit anyone behind heavy cover. Spray-n-Pray is a Complex action. While it is nominally possible for a bullet to impact a target more than 100 m away, the chances of this happening are so remote as to be discounted. Without Edge, it just won't happen.</p>
<h4 id="grab"><a class="header" href="#grab">Grab</a></h4>
<p>Characters can grab people and carry them off, toss them about, or strangle them. This is done quite frequently in horror movies and is an essential part of the genre. To Grab someone, the character takes a Complex Action to make an unarmed melee attack (Strength + Combat) against a normal threshold for attacking the victim. If the character gets as many net hits as half the target's Strength, the victim is held immobile by the attacker and may be carried or tossed around on their next action.</p>
<p>While held a victim may attempt to escape on their next round with a Simple Action, rolling Strength + Combat or Agility + Combat against with a threshold of the attacker's net hits, and may further attempt to escape one other time. The attacker may also use another Complex Action to try to establish a better hold against a threshold 1 less than normal due to the advantage they have over the target.</p>
<p>If the attacker's net hits <em>exceed</em> the required net hits, the victim is fully locked into a hold of the attacker's choosing, which may prevent them from screaming or using their limbs or used to strangle them to unconsciousness in 1 round.</p>
<h4 id="disarm"><a class="header" href="#disarm">Disarm</a></h4>
<p>Characters can grab items that other characters are carrying. In melee, this can be one by making an attack with a threshold equal to the target's Agility. If the target is <em>stronger</em> than the character trying to snatch the item, apply a negative dicepool modifier equal to the difference in Strength scores. If the character attempts to do this with bare hands, they will end up with the object in question in their possession if they get any net hits, but this is also quite dangerous and the character will be denied their defense in melee until their next turn. If the disarm is attempted with a weapon, or an unarmed Disarm attempt succeeds and gets no net hits, the item goes flying or falls to the ground or something as befits the situation. Attacking a held object at range is very difficult, such items are usually small and the threshold is increased by the target's own close combat defense.</p>
<h4 id="locking-on"><a class="header" href="#locking-on">Locking On</a></h4>
<p>Characters can prepare a weapon to be deployed. Maybe they hold a knife to the target's throat, maybe they point a gun at the target's back. This takes the time of a normal attack, but no actual attack is made. At any point in the future, the character can make their attack Reactively. If the character becomes distracted, moves faster than a Crawl or makes another attack (including another Lock On attempt), the old Lock On is lost. This is how the game handles &quot;stick ups,&quot; fencing, hostage threatening, and patient sniping.</p>
<h4 id="feint"><a class="header" href="#feint">Feint</a></h4>
<p>A character can attempt to distract or confuse an opponent, making an opening in a battle. Feinting is a Simple Action, and if it succeeds the target loses any &quot;Lock On&quot; they have and does not have the benefit of their Agility or Combat skill for purposes of setting thresholds on the character's attack against them if they follow it up with an attack of some kind (meaning the base threshold to strike them is likely zero). The character makes a Charisma + Expression or Agility + Tactics test and the target makes an Intuition + Empathy test. If the character gets <em>more</em> hits, the feint succeeds. While normally a character who has Locked On can use their attack reactively if the target (or anyone else) attempts any &quot;funny stuff&quot; - in the case of a Feint they have to wait to see if the Feint is successful in making them lose the Lock before taking their free shot. If the Feint fails, they can immediately use their attack in revenge, however.</p>

If the strength value of the weapon exceeds the character's Strength, the threshold to strike a target is increased by the difference, in addition to needing two hands.</p>

<h4 id="automatic-weapons"><a class="header" href="#automatic-weapons">Automatic Weapons</a></h4>
<p>A weapon firing on automatic throws out many bullets in a short period. This allows it to be used for suppressive fire, to be fired at multiple enemies who are close together, and makes it more likely to hit something. A weapon fired on automatic gains 3 dice on the attack roll, but the spread of bullets makes fine aiming more difficult - the increase in the threshold for firing at enemies with cover is doubled (basic cover increases threshold by 2 and heavy cover increases threshold by <em>4</em>). Also, the character can't take the Aim action with an automatic weapon, but they can take the Spray-n-Pray action.</p>
<h4 id="bullets"><a class="header" href="#bullets">Bullets</a></h4>
<p>The number of bullets fired off in genuine firefights is extremely varied and often frighteningly large. During a 12 second combat round, an assault rifle could easily fire 100 rounds or more (if it even had that many bullets in its magazine or belt-feed). Resolving where all of those bullets end up would be far too time-consuming to consider doing in most battles. As such, the game doesn't distinguish between characters that squeeze off large numbers of bullets and characters taking hard seconds to line up their targets and fire devastating double-taps into a target's vitals. As such, the game also doesn't bother writing up exactly how many bullets weapons contain. During survival horror segments, ammunition conservation can (and should) be a major concern, but in regular street combat it shouldn't come up.</p>
<p>It is also important to note that while the game only models those bullets that have a significant chance of hitting their target, every bullet fired <em>eventually</em> hits <em>something</em>. Stray bullets do not individually hit people we care about often enough to have such events generated by any combination of numbers on the dice, relegating that very real possibility to the realm of plot devices. However, in cases where the target is very close to other targets that these other targets are very likely to catch a bullet one way or another. If the target is getting cover from a creature and the target is missed by just the difference caused by the cover, then you can assume that the living cover is hit. Similarly, if the target is in or in front of a dense crowd of people, <em>someone</em> is getting hit. Deciding <em>who</em> is left as a narrative exercise. In such situations, Extras catch stray bullets much more than Luminaries.</p>
<h4 id="special-ammunition"><a class="header" href="#special-ammunition">Special Ammunition</a></h4>
<p>Characters in After Sundown will often want to fire bullets that are specifically made of iron, wood, or silver. While these bullets have different characteristics than ones made of copper or lead, that's a level of detail that combat in After Sundown does not go to. Asking for them at the gun store will draw notice and they aren't likely to have wood or silver in stock, but steel, wooden, and silver bullets can and have been made and work just fine.</p>
<p>Special ammunition exists that is generally more damaging. Whether it's made out of depleted uranium or is special explosive ammunition or whatever, such exotic equipment increases the damage of the gun by 1, costs quite a bit, and puts a real strain on the character's claim to not be a military-grade supervillain. Armor-piercing ammunition has the same availability issues, but instead reduces the ballistic protection of physical armor (but not magical toughness or force fields) by 2.</p>
<p>Smoothbore weaponry such as shotguns can be loaded with grains of pretty much anything, with &quot;less lethal&quot; baton rounds made of rubber or plastic used by law enforcement. Of special interest to characters in the realm of horror is that they can fill the shells with salt, sand, or seeds to suppress Astral, Infernal, or Orphic sorcery respectively. This is quite effective, and the character's Agility + Combat test can suppress magic out to the range of the weapon. Powder and other less-lethal shotgun loads have less impact than conventional shot, and do 3 normal damage instead of 5 lethal.</p>
<h4 id="silencers"><a class="header" href="#silencers">Silencers</a></h4>
<p>While firearms enthusiasts tend to prefer the term &quot;sound suppressor&quot;, since they don't reduce the sound of a weapon to nothing, in common usage &quot;silencer&quot; and &quot;sound suppressor&quot; are synonyms.</p>
<p>Silencers do reduce the sound of using the weapon substantially, to the point that its use will probably not be noticed on the other side of a wall; if a test is required, treat the threshold to notice or track the sound as 2 higher. The trade-off is that the weapon loses a lot of power, which reduces the Damage by 1 and reduces the accurate range by one category (for example: if you silence a light pistol it has a base damage of 1 and loses accuracy if fired at ranges beyond Adjacent).</p>
<p>Suppressors are controlled or illegal in some places, notably the United States. A silencer can be improvised out of plastic bottles or the like, but will fall apart with use. After more than a shot, an improvised silencer is useless garbage.</p>
<h3 id="melee-weapons"><a class="header" href="#melee-weapons">Melee Weapons</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;The sword is the axis of the world&quot;</em></p>
<p>Melee weaponry differs from ranged weaponry primarily in that it simply goes as far as it will reach and therefore doesn't have a &quot;range&quot; value on the table. Many melee weapons inherently do Normal rather than Lethal damage, and their damage values are followed by an &quot;N&quot;. Unlike Ranged Weaponry, which is mostly designed for the purpose, a majority of things that people use to beat on each other in hand to hand conflicts are improvised weapons: tools and household items that happen to be at hand when a fight breaks out.</p>

<p><strong>N</strong>: Weapon does Normal Damage.</p>
<h3 id="explosions"><a class="header" href="#explosions">Explosions</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;Can we make an explosion explode?&quot;</em></p>
<p>Sometimes things blow up, and in the movies, things blow up even more. Even when we step outside the action genre, it is a recognized fact that objects in general in any media - including cooperative horror storytelling - are substantially more <em>explosive</em> than they are in real life. Explosions physically expand in roughly spherical paths (barring the use of shaped charges), and thus in a general sort of way an explosion can be expected to become weaker as per the square of the distance from the point of origin. Except of course it's actually much more complicated than that because there's gravity and air resistance, and shrapnel pieces that fly a lot more like bullets, and so on. More massive shrapnel flies farther as it loses less power to air resistance, and compression waves pass through denser media better than air. And so on.</p>
<p>Game mechanically this is abstracted out into an explosion's <em>Damage</em> (which is how much damage targets in the first area have to soak), and the same explosion's <em>Radius</em> (which is how far that area extends). An explosion does damage to targets that are outside its Radius, but substantially less. A target that is farther away from the explosion than the Radius takes 2 less damage if they are within the Radius <em>of</em> the Radius. And this continues until the Damage reaches zero. In effect, the explosion is modeled in the game as an onion where each band has a thickness of the Radius and does 2 less damage than the band before it. In a nod to the truly epic destruction caused by explosives that are directly adjacent to the target, an explosion will inflict 2 <em>extra</em> damage if the explosive is actually touching the target when it goes off. Because of diminishing returns doubling the amount of explosive is equivalent to adding 2 additional damage.</p>
<p>An Explosion isn't normally affected by net hits on an attack roll, and inflict precisely the same damage if they are thrown perfectly as if they are detonated when simply dropped and forgotten. An exception to that is if an explosion is specifically placed to cause maximum damage. A character's Logic + Sabotage check can increase the damage bonus for a point-blank explosion. Explosions are affected strongly by cover, and their damage ratings are reduced by the coverage and its toughness. Explosions do not necessarily inflict fire damage, even though they do act by burning. Unless otherwise noted, the primary damage is flying shrapnel and concussive force. Explosives can be wrapped in silver, wood chips, or steel to make that shrapnel into something that is especially effective against certain supernatural creatures.</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong> Explosives do +2 damage when touching something, base damage inside the radius, and -2 damage for <em>each</em> step out in radius from there.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> Jack throws a fragmentation hand grenade at a group of Triad enforcers. He rolls his Strength + Combat to land the grenade right at the feet of the toughest-looking of them, getting 3 hits. That enforcer has to roll a Soak Test against 6L damage, as does everyone within 6 meters. Jack, standing a little too close at 10 meters has to soak 4 lethal damage, because he's within twice the radius.</p>
<h3 id="throwing-things"><a class="header" href="#throwing-things">Throwing Things</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;As soon as the first ape threw their first rock, primates started being a threat to leopards instead of just the other way around.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Characters will probably end up throwing a lot of stuff in an After Sundown campaign. Explosives, buckets of water, and even just plain chairs. It is well known that you can start a fight pretty much anywhere by throwing a chair in a crowd. When you're throwing something, you get bonuses to your attack roll if the thing is big. It is simply easier to connect with a target if you are throwing a whole car than if you are throwing a sharpened playing card. In general, a Small object (like a bottle or a hungamunga) provides +1 die, a medium object (like a tomahawk or a bucket of water) provides 2 extra dice, a large object (like a chair or a person) provides 4 extra dice, and a huge object (like a car or an altar) provides 6 extra dice. A character can throw things that they can lift but not effectively wield in melee because of their Strength being exceeded, but not very far. Such objects are only accurate out to Adjacent range and have a maximum range of Close. Items that the character can wield can be thrown out to Short Range</p>
<p>Damage inflicted by thrown weapons is usually pretty disappointing. Unless it's designed as a throwing weapon (or randomly shaped like something that is such as a bowling ball), the base damage of such thrown items is only going to be 0 or 1, depending upon hardness, sharpness, and density. Any object that is thrown into someone that is too heavy for them to use will knock them down, however. And if it's too heavy for them to lift, they may become trapped under it. So when a character throws a Molotov cocktail at an opponent, the damage from throwing the bottle into them is usually pretty inconsequential. The whole &quot;catching on fire&quot; thing is pretty keen though.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> Lacking any other weapons, Nolan grabs a round-looking rock off the ground to throw at some street toughs that are about 10 meters away. That's Close range, which means he doesn't have a range penalty. His player rolls his Strength + Athletics (since he's better with that than combat) + 0 bonus for a rock, and gets 3 hits against the threshold of 2 needed to hit a target at 10 meters. The tough has to make a Soak Test against 6 normal damage: 4 for Nolan's strength, 1 for the rock, and 1 for the net hit on the attack.</p>
<h2 id="armor--ppe"><a class="header" href="#armor--ppe">Armor &amp; PPE</a></h2>
<p><em>&quot;Some people wear their armor on the inside, as some sort of metaphorical refusal to emotionally connect with others. I find that kevlar vests are much more effective at stopping bullets.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Characters will sometimes wear armor or other protective gear. Armor makes it less likely that a character will die when placed into a deadly situation. Armor is heavier than normal clothes, and wearing it is tiring. However, there are characters in After Sundown who have Idomitability and literally never tired. They can wear armor all the time, even to sleep. It should be noted however that most of the world has a level of civilization that makes wearing armor problematic socially.</p>
<p>Armor has a different rating against different kinds of attacks. The Ballistics rating applies against guns and explosives and the like. The Melee rating applies against knives and claws in addition to baseball bats and large thrown objects like rocks and cars. And finally, the Heat value applies against getting set on fire and also cold. The rating of armor adds additional soak dice. Also, a character with an armor rating can buy hits on soak tests at the rate of 1 hit per three dice.</p>
<p>Most armor does not cover the character's whole body, and an attacker who knows about the armor can attack the unarmored bits by voluntarily increasing their to-hit threshold by 1. For armor that truly covers the whole body, such as riot gear or hazmat suits, that is not an option. Remember that outré armor like that is often rather hard to explain socially, so even characters who <em>could</em> wear such comfortably usually don't.</p>
<p>Modern armor wears out <em>quickly</em> and needs to be replaced after taking ballistic damage in a single engagement, although most of it is designed and tested for protecting against a few hits in an engagement.</p>

<p><em>&quot;Are you still on fire? You should stop that eventually.&quot;</em></p>
<p>When a character is soaked in acid, freezing to death, on fire, or otherwise subjected to a damaging situation that is ongoing, we call this DOT or Damage Over Time. While it <em>could</em> be modeled as a series of tiny attacks that had a remote chance of doing damage each second, that is far fiddlier than the people playing the game need to deal with. DOT damage is added one wound box at a time. A DOT effect has a &quot;delay&quot; number, and that number determines how much time passes between filling in one wound box and the next. When a DOT is introduced to a character, they may make a Resistance Test against it, and the hits on that test are <em>added</em> to the Delay Number rather than <em>subtracting</em> from the actual damage done. Being covered in acid for long enough is liable to be a problem for anyone. DOT's will continue filling in a wound box on schedule until they end. For external sources of damage, that generally means removing the noxious stimulus, while something like an injected poison usually has an amount of time it will persist based on how much was injected (this time could be cut shorter with things like antidotes or diuretics).</p>

<p><em>&quot;Don't touch that. Or that either.&quot;</em></p>
<h4 id="falling"><a class="header" href="#falling">Falling</a></h4>
<p>Characters will fall from time to time. And falling substantial distances actually can take quite an amount of time. However, in a 12-second combat round a character could almost reach terminal velocity and fall over 600 meters, so for practical purposes, it's usually best to simply have characters hit the ground after having just one Simple Action to try to do something about their situation. It is also true that &quot;The bigger they are, the harder they fall.&quot; That's not just a trite saying that He Man gives before tripping giant robots, it's physical reality. Larger creatures have more mass proportional to their surface area and accelerate at the same speed, truly mice and ants can survive being dropped from any height and elephants can't even jump without breaking their bones on the way down. Game mechanically this truth is handled by preventing characters from using Strength or Armor to soak falling damage, and by having larger creatures take additional damage from falls. Characters can soak damage from falls by performing Agility + Athletics stunts with a threshold of 1 (net hits soak damage, but the first hit does not). Magical benefits for soaking damage do apply (as they make the character tougher relative to their mass rather than adding additional mass), so a character gains the benefits of Fortitude.</p>
<p>If the character falls onto a hard or sharp surface, increase damage by 1 or more. If the falling creature is large, increase the damage by 1 or more. If the falling creature is small, reduce the damage by 1 or more.</p>
<p>In reality, the increase in velocity over distance and therefore time is nonlinear, but for ease of approximation treat each additional 10 meters as one additional damage. Humanish characters reach terminal velocity after around 450 m of free-fall, which we set somewhat arbitrarily as enough damage to kill a normal person twice over.</p>

<p>Electricity damage is something of a paradox. Electricity flows through the path of least resistance, and it inflicts damage based on the resistance of the path it flows through. Thus, you can defend yourself from electricity by covering yourself in high resistance insulation (because it will redirect electricity away from your body to another path) <em>or</em> by covering yourself with low resistance conductive mesh (because it will <em>create</em> a preferred path through the mesh and away from your organs). From the standpoint of the game, a character who is protected by especially conductive or non-conductive material is <em>immune</em> to electrical shocks.</p>
<p>Electricity is inherently unpredictable, whenever someone is electrocuted, roll a die - if it comes up a hit, increase the Damage by 1. Net hits on attacks with electrical outputs are not added to the damage of an electric shock. If the source is continuous like the character has grabbed a live wire, the induced muscle contractions may make it hard to let go continue to inflict damage; a reflexive Strength + Athletics test is made to break away each round, using the Damage as a Rating to determine the threshold.</p>

<h3 id="poison"><a class="header" href="#poison">Poison</a></h3>
<p>Poison has a progressive effect that affects the target more as time goes on. Functionally this means that poison is <em>much slower</em> than bullets or chainsaws. The way this is handled is as a DOT. However, not all poisons inflict actual damage, many come with special effects in addition to or instead of filling in wound boxes. Poisons normally only accumulate effects for a certain amount of time, based on the original dose. When a victim is exposed to additional doses before the first has run its course, use the current timer for how long the poison will last and reduce the Delay by 1 if the timer is less than half over, or leave the Delay number alone and reset the termination timer if it has run more than half of its course. Characters with Patience of the Mountains or Tongue of the Serpent are immune to poisons. If a character is given anti-venom or some similar treatment, the character gains additional resistance dice to increase the Delay and/or the termination counter is reduced in length (depending on whether it works by clearing the chemical from the victim's system or neutralizing the effects). Note that the dosages are all the &quot;normal&quot; dosages, which for &quot;recreational&quot; poisons (like street drugs) are very small. Poisons may be more or less effective if administered by another route (injecting pepper spray would be all kinds of fatal). The assumption is that street drugs are being snorted unless otherwise indicated. The secondary effects of a poison kick in as soon as one damage box is filled in (or would be filled in for non-damaging poisons), and end when the Timer runs out. Damage, whether Normal or Lethal, remains until healed.</p>

<p><em>&quot;It was a dark and stormy night...&quot;</em></p>
<p>It is important to note that weather in the realm of horror is a fair bit worse than the weather of our own world. Just as nearly every horror movie begins with some driving rain and a crash of thunder to set the mood, the night sky of the stories you tell with After Sundown will pelt the earth with lightning and rain all the time. It's atmospheric, and it helps to enforce the feeling of isolation that so many variations of scary stories require.</p>
<h3 id="rain"><a class="header" href="#rain">Rain</a></h3>
<p>Water falls from the sky. It's dreary, it's uncomfortable, and it makes it hard to see things that are far away. It also makes things very wet, which is why witches wear wide-brimmed hats. But the important thing from the standpoint of <em>game mechanics</em> is the fact that it makes things wet and makes it hard to see.</p>

<p>Tumultuous Rain and Uncompromising Deluge effectively block out the sun.</p>
<h3 id="ice--snow"><a class="header" href="#ice--snow">Ice &amp; Snow</a></h3>
<p>While falling sleet or freezing rain isn't much different than regular rain, falling snow obscures as one category worse and has a tendency to dampen sound as well. There is also the consideration that frozen water tends to accumulate in ways that rain usually doesn't. A thin coating of ice or a thick blanket of snow create difficult terrain, which affects not only a character's normal movement but also any driving they may attempt.</p>
<h3 id="fog-and-dust"><a class="header" href="#fog-and-dust">Fog and Dust</a></h3>
<p>When there's fog in the air it reduces contrast and obscures. It scatters light sources and can paradoxically cause people to be blinded by glare if they shine lights trying to see better. But mostly it saves us money on sets because far away things become indistinct and altogether invisible. As fog becomes thicker, the distance one can see is reduced (increasing the threshold on Perception tests and attacks by 1), and the distance one can see anything at all is reduced as well. Bright lights get scattered in fog and produce glare. Fog can cause reduced visibility <em>and</em> overstimulation at the same time.</p>
<p>Great clouds or storms of ash, dust, or smoke have much the same effect (and levels of thickness) as fog, but also represent a breathing hazard to those without protection or even an independent air supply (or that just don't have to breathe at all). On the other hand, their light-absorbing particles do not create a glare when light is shed within them.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="wounds"><a class="header" href="#wounds">Wounds</a></h2>
<p><em>&quot;Okay, that hurt.&quot;</em></p>
<p>When a character would take damage, they are usually allowed to soak that damage. This involves rolling a Resistance Test (normally Strength), with the hits subtracted from the incoming damage. If the damage is reduced to zero, the character takes no perceptible harm, otherwise they suffer a wound. Some number of boxes of the character's condition monitor will be filled up. All characters (and most objects worth bothering about) have 10 boxes on their condition monitor. When boxes are filled in, they are marked depending on the type of damage that caused the wound:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th style="text-align: left">Damage Type</th><th style="text-align: center">Box</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td style="text-align: left">Normal</td><td style="text-align: center"><code>[/]</code></td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align: left">Lethal</td><td style="text-align: center"><code>[X]</code></td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align: left">Aggravated</td><td style="text-align: center"><code>[*]</code></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>For ease of accounting, the game arranges all wound marks in the order of Aggravated, then Lethal, then Normal. As new wound marks of any type accumulate they push lesser marks to the right of the track. If a damage mark would be pushed off of the track entirely simply discard it. The only exception to this is if a character's track is already filled with Normal marks when you start adding a Normal wound: in that case, you should convert existing Normal marks into Lethal marks on a one-for-one basis.</p>
<p>When all 10 of a character's boxes fill up with any kind of damage they are <strong>Incapacitated</strong>. They might or might not be conscious, but they cannot attempt any action that requires a dice roll, and they can at best crawl around at a Crawl.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the character's rightmost box is filled in with a forward slash (<code>[/]</code>), they are in no immediate danger (at least not from their wounds, being incapacitated in a place where you just <em>took</em> a wound implies a certain level of urgency in most cases).</li>
<li>If the character's rightmost box is filled in with a backslash (<code>[\\]</code>), they gain the Dying condition with one hour to live (see the Healing and Death section). This usually comes directly from Lethal or Aggravated wounds, but note that wound marks heal separately so it's possible to have just the backslash itself.</li>
</ul>
<p>A character can also suffer a Terminal wound, which is much like an Incapacitating wound (in that all of your condition boxes will be filled up with a mark), but the character gains the Dying condition with only 5 minutes to live. Even a Normal damage attack can cause a Terminal wound (eg: an unlucky rubber bullet or boxer's punch), and then someone had better be on hand with CPR or the curtain is coming down.</p>

<p>If a character takes 10 or more post-soak damage they are instantly and bloodily killed. Feel free to describe graphic injuries such as exploding heads and bodies torn in half. Restoration still works if you can assemble most of the heart and head back into a pile.</p>
<h3 id="damage-penalties"><a class="header" href="#damage-penalties">Damage Penalties</a></h3>
<p>When a character has been <em>recently</em> damaged, their ability to act is extremely impaired. The character's actions take a penalty equal to the number of boxes on their condition monitor that have a forward slash (<code>[/]</code>). This includes any Normal (<code>[/]</code>), Lethal (<code>[X]</code>) or Aggravated (<code>[~~X~~]</code>) wound boxes.</p>
<p>A character with the Indomitably power ignores wound penalties completely.</p>
<h2 id="healing-and-death"><a class="header" href="#healing-and-death">Healing and Death</a></h2>
<p><em>Good as new<br />
...or not...</em></p>
<p>When characters are injured, there are two possibilities: they can either get better or not. Medically speaking, injured tissue can resolve into healed or regenerated tissue, it can resolve into a scar, or it can die. This is much farther in-depth than we care to go into.</p>
<p>When a character is given time to heal, they reduce the number of boxes that are filled in with a type of wound mark by 2. The character must also succeed on a Healing Test or the damage will fester: Normal or Lethal marked healed will add a mark of the next higher damage type, and Aggravated marks will heal only 1 mark instead of 2. Note that when a wound festers on a character who's already Incapacitated it can potentially send them into a Dying state, as normal for taking new damage marks. The time required for natural healing depends on the type of wound.</p>

<p>If a character is running around being the Action Man, they don't heal at all. Healing doesn't really happen until the character takes some time off from ninja flips and car chases. The exception is characters who have suffered Incapacitating or Terminal injuries, who start the cycle of healing and possible death right away.</p>
<p>If a character's entire track is filled, the character's healing timeframe is increased by one step until they have at least one box that has no wounds in it. Normal marks will take 1 hour to heal, Lethal marks will take 3 days to heal, and Aggravated marks will take an entire week to heal.</p>

<h3 id="dying-and-stabilization"><a class="header" href="#dying-and-stabilization">Dying and Stabilization</a></h3>
<p>When a character is in a Dying state, the condition must be removed in time (&quot;stabilizing&quot; their condition) or they die.</p>
<ul>
<li>The character can spend an Edge to automatically stabilize.</li>
<li>The character without Edge still gets to roll a Healing Test to stabilize.</li>
<li>Someone else can apply First Aid to stabilize the character.</li>
</ul>
<p>When a Healing Test or First Aid is involved, a result of 1 or 2 hits increases the timer on the Dying condition by either 20 minutes or 1 hour respectively. This allows time for the character to potentially be moved to a place with a better shot at a final test before they die. A result of 3 hits or more causes the character to stabilize right away.</p>
<p>Characters with a Terminal Wound will normally die within 5 minutes. This is not normally enough time to allow for a Healing Test. However, Dying characters are always allowed to make at least one final Healing Test before their Dying timer runs out.</p>
<p>A character who is already Dying can also have their death hastened with further injury. Once the character's rightmost wound box is filled with a Lethal or Aggravated mark, additional wounds accumulate towards a threshold of outright killing the target.</p>
<ul>
<li>Incapacitating or Terminal wounds add 2 towards a character's Death Threshold.</li>
<li>Any other wound adds 1.</li>
</ul>
<p>A character's Death Threshold limit is equal to their Willpower, though this can be increased by knowing Lure of Destruction magic. Yes, this all means that once someone is already on death's door, it takes quite a few extra bullets to push them through it - it's not like they are going to go <em>into</em> shock at that point.</p>
<h3 id="the-healing-test"><a class="header" href="#the-healing-test">The Healing Test</a></h3>
<p>When a character is Healing they will often need to make a Healing Test. This can be called for as either a part of natural healing to prevent wound marks from festering, or when trying to prevent the Dying condition from ending the character's life.</p>
<p>A Healing Test is Edge + Survival, modified by the local conditions. If another character is on hand to provide medical care their Logic + Medicine works as a Teamwork Test with the character's own roll (whoever has the smaller dice pool counts as the assistant).</p>

<h3 id="first-aid"><a class="header" href="#first-aid">First Aid</a></h3>
<p>When a character is trained in first aid, they can reduce the amount of damage to someone substantially. This is pretty much a one-time deal and has to be performed within the &quot;golden hour&quot; of the injury (an hour from when the patient was injured, not an hour from first medical contact). First aid is a Logic + Medicine test. 1 hit removes 2 forward slashes, 2 hits remove1 2 backslashes, 3 hits remove 2 dashes, and any additional hits remove 1 mark of each type. So, a 5 hit First Aid test would remove 4 marks of each type.</p>
<p>If the victim is currently Dying you must first put a stop to that. This is a Threshold 3 test. Any Net Hits will also remove 1 wound mark of each type.</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest advantage of First Aid is the <em>time</em> it takes to make the first healing test during medical treatment: one-time frame shorter than usual for the left-most injury type in the wound track. So it's only 1 minute to rouse someone from Normal Damage, 5 minutes to treat Lethal Damage, and 20 minutes to treat Aggravated damage.</p>
<h3 id="being-dead"><a class="header" href="#being-dead">Being Dead</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;Okay, <strong>now</strong> we go through the pockets looking for loose change.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Characters in horror die from time to time. Sometimes a character will end up dying several times, because After Sundown posits ghastly life after death and even has magical ways to restore life. When a character dies, all of their powers that cost Magic Points to activate or which otherwise last for a scene end. Also, anything they have going that could be dispelled is dispelled with their death. A character's Power Pool is also emptied at the moment the character actually dies. Very importantly, a character's power schedule (if any) does not change just because they are dead. A Strigoi can still be fed blood to regain Magic Points and a Frankenstein can still be recharged while a corpse. This usually only matters if they have the Restoration Power, but there are other ways to raise the dead, and it might be important that they rise up with a power reserve on hand.</p>
<p>The dead may also come back as Ghosts, whether they are Luminaries or Extras. In After Sundown, no one becomes a Ghost until they've been dead for three settings of the sun. There are movies in which the spirit is left standing there as the body hits the floor, and there are movies in which the spirit wakes up having been dead and buried for a couple days. After Sundown's assumed setting is the latter.</p>
<p>Sometimes a player may want to continue their character as a Wraith rather than start a new character or have their character restored to life. This is a workable storyline, but it is fraught with peril because Wraiths are not normally considered playable (being constantly insubstantial while outside the Gloom). If the players agree, the character can be converted into a Wraith, with their powers traded out for the basic Wraith abilities, starting what is in essence a new Origin Story. Being a Wraith should not be a license to print superpowers, so the new powers that Wraiths get should replace some of the abilities they already had rather than piling on.</p>
<h2 id="stress-trauma-and-recovery"><a class="header" href="#stress-trauma-and-recovery">Stress, Trauma, and Recovery</a></h2>
<p><em>&quot;Call of Cthulhu has an endearing and heartwarming faith in the capabilities of the 1920s psychiatric establishment to heal trauma.&quot; --thingofthings</em></p>
<p>When mortal characters accumulate Stress they get closer and closer to panic, the closest they get to the Fury and Despondency of actual monsters. Trauma is not something that necessarily gets better on its own. Without treatment, the character will tend to accumulate additional Stress that makes them more unstable in much the same way that wounds can fester. Of course, many people consciously or unconsciously try to treat themselves with various means including prayer, meditation, distraction, and drug and alcohol abuse, and sometimes it might even help a little, or at least turn a potential source of panic into a mental illness that's only debilitating in the course of normal life, not surviving horror scenarios, where paranoia, rage, and obsession might be survival traits.</p>
<p>Psychological treatment does not work well for monsters. For one thing, almost no one will believe them about what their actual problems are, and their psychology has aspects that are truly inhuman and that psychological science has not studied. Master Passions do not respond well to conventional treatment short of giving someone enough drugs to induce catatonia.</p>
<p>Similar to the Healing Test, the psychological recovery test is Edge + TK(not Survival).</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="temporary-conditions"><a class="header" href="#temporary-conditions">Temporary Conditions</a></h2>
<p><em>&quot;Just as water has no constant shape, so there are no constant conditions.&quot;</em></p>
<p>The following is a sample set of conditions that might transiently affect a character in After Sundown games. These conditions are generic cases, a character can be &quot;more Delusional&quot; or whatever, in which case the raw numerics of the effect should be increased.</p>
<h3 id="condition-descriptions"><a class="header" href="#condition-descriptions">Condition Descriptions</a></h3>
<h4 id="agony"><a class="header" href="#agony">Agony</a></h4>
<p>The victim is in incredible wracking pain. Their Wound penalties are calculated as if they had two more boxes filled in than they do with Normal marks, up to a maximum of all boxes filled. Sensory Damper and Indomitability prevent the penalties of Agony.</p>
<h4 id="amnesia"><a class="header" href="#amnesia">Amnesia</a></h4>
<p>Drinking to the point of blacking out will cause a man to lose an evening, and in game terms when a character is not going to remember things they are operating under Amnesia. In the real world there are many ways to get to this state, most of which involve chemicals. When a character is operating under Amnesia they suffer a -2 dicepool penalty to actions and the threshold to resist acting impulsively (including succumbing to Frenzy) is increased by 1. Also remember that the character <em>won't</em> remember anything, so it can sometimes be a good narrative tool to skip ahead in the story and then go back and roleplay those events later as a flashback.</p>
<h4 id="anesthetic"><a class="header" href="#anesthetic">Anesthetic</a></h4>
<p>The character is neither bothered by, nor aware of, noxious stimuli. That means that pain doesn't bother them, but they also miss things that an unaffected person would notice. The character calculates Wound penalties as if two less boxes were filled in, but the character is at -2 dice on Perception or Empathy tests.</p>
<h4 id="blindness"><a class="header" href="#blindness">Blindness</a></h4>
<p>The character cannot see. Without practice navigating by other senses, the character has difficulty even moving around and treats everything as difficult ground if moving at more than a Careful pace. The character's attacks are penalized by 3 dice and their difficulty perceiving attacks lowers the threshold to hit them at Adjacent range by 1. Many of these penalties can be reduced or obviated by Discernment powers that enhance the character's other senses.</p>
<h4 id="deafness"><a class="header" href="#deafness">Deafness</a></h4>
<p>The character cannot hear. Primarily, this means they can't hear what anyone is saying, but they may be able to get the gist from body language or lipreading. If not used to silence being Deafened can be disorienting, but one of the primary concerns is that a character will not be aware of any attacks they cannot see or feel and thus do not get their normal defense threshold or ability to Dodge those attacks.</p>
<h4 id="delusion"><a class="header" href="#delusion">Delusion</a></h4>
<p>When a character is afflicted by Delusion they respond to things in an irrational fashion. Sometimes this can be well articulated as in the case where a character hallucinates tiny shapes moving in their peripheral vision they'll jump at shadows and, as they acclimatize themselves to their situation, <em>ignore</em> actual moving objects. And that just looks disconcerting to other people. Sometimes a character's delusions will be harder to articulate, but they will be no less disconcerting to those around them. A character suffering from Delusions is opposed on all Social tests by 3 dice. And yes, they can end up with negative hits.</p>
<h4 id="fatigue"><a class="header" href="#fatigue">Fatigue</a></h4>
<p>A character who is fatigued has a great deal of difficulty exerting themselves or remaining alert. They cannot Run or Sprint. Their effective Strength is reduced by 1. And yes, that means that their Soak is reduced. When the body's reserves are exhausted, they are more vulnerable. Finally, if not actively engaged the character has difficulty remaining awake and alert and can easily fall asleep.</p>
<h4 id="incapacitated"><a class="header" href="#incapacitated">Incapacitated</a></h4>
<p>Physical damage or other problems have almost completely disabled the character. They might or might not be conscious, but they cannot attempt any action that requires a dice roll, and they can at best move at a Crawl.</p>
<h4 id="maimed"><a class="header" href="#maimed">Maimed</a></h4>
<p>Physical or neurological damage has rendered part of the character's body unusable. A character with a maimed leg can at best move at a Careful pace; with two maimed legs they are restricted to a crawl (assuming they only have two; Eightfold Grasp still helps). A maimed arm cannot be used to hold anything or make attacks (unless you tear it off and hit someone with it). A maimed head could result in the character being Blinded, Deafened, or Mute. A Maim can be resolved with an application of Revive the Flesh, but if magical healing is not an option substantial medical intervention is required.</p>
<h4 id="overstimulation"><a class="header" href="#overstimulation">Overstimulation</a></h4>
<p>When a character's sensory input is greater than their ability to handle that sensory input, it can be disorienting and paralyzing. Usually this comes from being exposed to really bright lights or loud noises, such as those produced by a flashbang grenade. But it can also come from within by having a character's senses sensitized (such as from atropine, ecstasy, or the bite of a Strigoi). In any case, when a character is Overstimulated their Initiative is reduced by 2 and their physical actions suffer a -2 dicepool penalty. The character also needs to make an Intuition + Perception test with a threshold of 2 to even target specific things in the overstimulated sense. A character who is primed to be overstimulated (by a poison or by enhancing their own senses) is not penalized until they are actually confronted with bright lights or equivalent stimuli.</p>
<h4 id="panic"><a class="header" href="#panic">Panic</a></h4>
<p>A panicked character is experiencing intense fear that is overwhelming their reason. Panic largely limits the character to basic fight/flight/freeze actions. Any Logic tests the character takes are penalized by -4 dice, as are any Charisma tests to do more than fawn at a source of danger. Most supernatural monsters will go into Frenzy when panicked.</p>
<h4 id="paralysis"><a class="header" href="#paralysis">Paralysis</a></h4>
<p>A fully paralyzed character cannot move. They may or may not be able to move their eyes or blink, depending upon which is more horrible, but they cannot move their arms or even turn their head. The victim's Agility is zero. Paralysis often goes away gradually, with a victim regaining their Agility one point at a time. Severe paralysis caused by toxins such as curare or particular nerve damage can stop the character's breathing and cause them to suffocate.</p>
<h4 id="stimulation"><a class="header" href="#stimulation">Stimulation</a></h4>
<p>The character is filled with vigor and energy. Any fatigue or tiredness they feel is postponed until the end of the effect (at which point they will also <em>become</em> fatigued even if they weren't before). The character is incapable of resting during this period.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="monsters"><a class="header" href="#monsters">Monsters</a></h1>
<p>There are mythical sources that will back up pretty much any supernatural creature being weak or immune to pretty much anything you can imagine; for example, vampires who have to count seeds, or who are repulsed by sticky rice. This infinitude must be narrowed down for <em>playable</em> types of monsters so that players can understand the strengths and weaknesses of their own characters.</p>
<p>Remember that each supernatural character fits into two categories: they are of a broad supernatural type (vampire, lycanthrope, etc.), and they also have a power source (Astral, Infernal, or Orphic). Every <em>playable</em> supernatural creature is available with every power source, and each aspect carries a weakness. The <em>nonplayable</em> monsters also have subtypes, but they come from one of the Otherworlds, so every subtype has the same power source and shared weaknesses.</p>
<h2 id="slaying-monsters-in-general"><a class="header" href="#slaying-monsters-in-general">Slaying Monsters (in general)</a></h2>
<p><em>&quot;Bullets! My only weakness!&quot;</em></p>
<p>You <em>can</em> hurt just about anything by just running it over with a car. However, many monsters have supernatural defenses that make them incredibly tough. There are a couple of universal weapons that cut through crap like regeneration and magic force fields. Each type of creature you are trying to kill has a <em>vulnerability</em> to a particular material. When used on the appropriate foe, these weapons inflict aggravated damage and negate soak bonuses from disciplines. Note that just <em>having</em> a high Strength with the aid of a power like Giant Size would not constitute a soak bonus, but that a specific soak bonus (including bonus armor) such as those provided by Force Field or the passive benefit of Fortitude, is negated by a monster's vulnerability.</p>
<h3 id="wood"><a class="header" href="#wood">Wood</a></h3>
<p>In many songs and stories, only special wood counts against the forces of darkness. Maybe it is oak, banyan, or sacred ash. But it doesn't matter. Wood represents life even when it is dead, dry, and laminated.</p>
<p><strong>Wood</strong> is effective against Animates, Vampires, Mockeries, Zombies, and Ghosts.</p>
<h3 id="iron"><a class="header" href="#iron">Iron</a></h3>
<p>Seriously, <em>Iron</em>. Like the stuff that your steel knives are made of. It's a symbol of modernity and industrialization, and it classically drives away the old chthonic stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Iron</strong> is effective against Leviathan, Transhumans, Evil Plants, Goblins, and Fey.</p>
<h3 id="silver"><a class="header" href="#silver">Silver</a></h3>
<p>Shiny and inconstant like the Moon, silver is hard enough to kill a man and easy enough to cast that you can do it before the invention of bronze. Silver is clearly magical, and is lethal to creatures as ephemeral and primal as it is.</p>
<p><strong>Silver</strong> is effective against Witches, Lycanthropes, Giant Animals, Hellspawn, and Demons.</p>
<h2 id="weakening-supernatural-creatures"><a class="header" href="#weakening-supernatural-creatures">Weakening Supernatural Creatures</a></h2>
<p>There are a lot of things that won't burn the flesh of monsters, but <em>will</em> deplete their powers. They can be used to imprison them, or take their powers away long enough to beat them in a fight. When exposed to their particular kryptonite, a supernatural creature's powers are weakened in several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Their Potency is considered zero, and any of their attributes that are raised past their normal maximum are considered to be their normal maximum (usually 6 for former humans).</li>
<li>They cannot spend Magic Points, and any powers they activated this scene with Magic Points already have no further effect for as long as the character's powers are suppressed.</li>
<li>They cannot spend an action required to activate any power.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that Weakening does not remove <strong>all</strong> of a monster's supernatural abilities; in particular, <em>Passive</em> powers keep working just fine.</p>
<h3 id="alcohol"><a class="header" href="#alcohol">Alcohol</a></h3>
<p>It has to be very strong beer to count, but in general, if you get some good old-fashioned spirits onto (or into) supernatural creatures they have a hard time using their powers. Consumed alcohol wears off in about an hour, and alcohol spilled on a creature cleans up with club soda. Cheap booze in fragile bottles is usually the preferred application for throwing, but any number of libations can be used to tempt the target into drinking.</p>
<p><strong>Effective against</strong> Evil Plants, Lycanthropes, Animates, Giant Animals, and Hellspawn</p>
<h3 id="water"><a class="header" href="#water">Water</a></h3>
<p>Getting wet is a real problem for some evil beings. Unlike with alcohol, water vulnerabilities don't trigger in any way off of being <em>drunk</em>. The creature's powers are dampened only so long as their exterior is wet. Moderate dampness doesn't count either, a half-liter or more Wicked Witch of the West <em>wet</em> is needed (and they don't even melt, they just can't spend Magic Points and such). In former times &quot;holy water&quot; ampoules blown of thin glass were common materiel for witch-hunting, but modern hunters in the know prefer water balloons.</p>
<p><strong>Effective against</strong> Demons, Witches, Transhumans, Goblins, and Fey</p>
<h3 id="sunlight"><a class="header" href="#sunlight">Sunlight</a></h3>
<p>The harsh light of the day star robs evil creatures of their strength. The sunlight has to be fairly direct; sufficient cloud or fog cover and it won't affect them, nor will the reflected light off of the Moon or mirrors.</p>
<p><strong>Effective against</strong> Vampires, Ghosts, Mockeries, Zombies, and Leviathan</p>
<h2 id="neutralizing-monster-powers"><a class="header" href="#neutralizing-monster-powers">Neutralizing Monster Powers</a></h2>
<p>If you can't directly kill or weaken a monster, you may be able to detect and counter some of its abilities. Further details are in the Magic chapter.</p>
<h2 id="power-schedules"><a class="header" href="#power-schedules">Power Schedules</a></h2>
<p><em>&quot;It's five o'clock, time for your ass whupping.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Magic Points are regained on a <em>schedule</em> that varies depending on the type of supernatural creature. This means that different characters and enemies will need to do different things to restore their powers, which will occasionally come up as a substantial advantage or disadvantage for one character or another, depending upon the circumstances. Sometimes this can be forced against a character due to the needs of the plot, and other times the characters can figure out how to use the intricacies of their power regaining system. The precise details vary by type, but each monster falls under one of the following broad categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Feeding</strong> - The character must feed upon mortals (or other more-or-less sentient supernatural beings) to regain Magic Points. This has obvious advantages and disadvantages. Firstly, they can often schedule their power gains whenever. People are all over the place,and you can take time out of your schedule to devour them whenever you aren't pressed for time. Of course, when you're in polite company or you <em>are</em> pressed for time, that may not be possible. Also, leaving a trail of victims is a dangerous thing to do, even if you can wipe their memories - it angers people. It angers people who are luminaries. A character gains one Magic Point for every lethal wound box inflicted with the character's idiom. You'll note that a mortal always has 10 boxes, and even a starting character's Power Reserve goes up to 13, so a desperately hungry character may need multiple victims. A character Feeding on a human (or supernatural creature with living flesh) can take one Magic Point for every lethal wound box inflicted, but usually characters who want to go from empty to full will want to non-fatally feed on more than one mortal. The actual consumption of Magic Points takes place at the rate of 1 Magic Point every 12 seconds (1 turn during high-resolution action scenes) and requires consumption during the entire period. The wound doesn't have to be inflicted in bite-size pieces - it is entirely possible to cause someone a single Serious wound (6 boxes) and then lick the blood up (or whatever else one does) for 72 seconds to gain 6 Magic Points. Feeding on Vampires (as well as Revenants and Akuma) is <em>relatively</em> non-harmful, as their living blood isn't <em>theirs</em> to begin with. In that case, Magic Points can be drained out at a rate of 1 per 12 seconds without actually injuring the victim.</li>
<li><strong>Lunar</strong> - The character regains all of their Magic Points when the Moon rises. Such characters may pull fancy time shenanigans where their powers are restored fully in the middle of major scenes. Unfortunately, they also have to wait about an entire day between times when they get their powers back. And yes, that can be a long wait at the North or South Poles. Try not to get imprisoned in those places. On the other hand, whatever weird celestial bodies exist in the other worlds, they do get the job done, and the character doesn't have to <em>see</em> the Moon to get their Magic Points back.</li>
<li><strong>Ritual</strong> - Characters on the ritual schedule have a specific and time-consuming action they have to perform in order to regain their Magic Points. This takes substantially longer than feeding on a mortal (usually about 2 hours), but hopefully entails less personal risk than actually victimizing someone. The ritual required varies depending upon the type of monster, but usually requires special equipment. For example, a Robot may need to hook themselves up to special equipment to physcially recharge their batteries while one of the Fallen has to bathe in the magical glow from their artifact. Special circumstances may be available to reduce the ritual time below the 2-hour standard. For example, a Galatean or Frankenstein could recharge <em>faster</em> if they were hooked up to a giant hydroelectric dam than they could with their equipment hooked up to the normal power grid in their home.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="tragic-flaws"><a class="header" href="#tragic-flaws">Tragic Flaws</a></h2>
<p><em>&quot;It's not all turning into a giant homicidal monster; there are also parts of the curse that are genuinely bad.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Being supernatural is not without its drawbacks. As you can see from watching pretty much any horror movie <em>ever</em>, the life of a monster is filled with unfortunate conditions. The most painful of these are the crushing mental instabilities that come with the territory. Every supernatural being goes at least somewhat crazy and is a danger to themselves and others. In game terms, this is represented by the Master Passions. Each character gets one if they are a monster. The precise way that a character goes mad is a deeply personal one, and players may (and should) select one that feels right for them. The suggested Master Passion for each supernatural creature type is just that - a suggestion. While it may be the most common Master Passion that dominates the lives of that kind of creature, there is nothing inherently weird about a Werewolf or Troglodyte that happens to spiral into madness in some other way. Nothing weirder than the fact that they <em>are</em> a murderous inhuman monster with claws, anyway.</p>
<p>But other limitations affect supernatural creatures in a more universal and less personal fashion. Every member of a single class of supernatural monster has a Distinctive Flaw, which is a Disadvantage common to their type. The player does not normally get any choice in the matter; <em>every</em> Werewolf has the Temperamental Disadvantage. The character does not gain any compensatory Advantages for this Distinctive Flaw. If someone becomes a monster and already has the Distinctive Flaw for the type they are becoming, then they must either gain a new Disadvantage (chosen to be appropriate to the character) or abandon one of their Advantages. As monsters grow in power, they develop further Disadvantages, generally related to their type or the particular incidents that lead to their increased Potency.</p>

<p>Lycanthropy is a disease that passes from lycanthropes to people that are nearly killed at their jaws. All that is necessary to become a lycanthrope is to be bitten, nearly die, and yet survive the ordeal. It's like rabies. Only your heart has to stop at least for a little while.</p>
<p>Once afflicted, a newly created Lycanthrope will find their wounds closing rapidly. The essentially deadly injuries suffered in the initial attack heal without leaving a scar or discoloration to mark their passing. The victim will feel feverish to the touch and chilled in the chest - a condition that will follow them until the end of their days.</p>
<p>There isn't any ancient lycanthrope culture. For the vast majority of the time, a lycanthrope would come into being only by surviving an attack by another lycanthrope. As such, most lycanthropes came into the world with their creator either defeated or hostile. The vast majority of lycanthropes either learned the ins and outs of their condition on their own or had it explained to them by someone else in the know (usually another supernatural). So it is quite common for lycanthropes to be adapted into the cultures of <em>other</em> supernatural creatures. A Werewolf who was taken in by witches would generally have the same traditions and prejudices as those witches, not those of whatever Werewolf tore into him with its fangs and left him for dead.</p>
<p>An exception to that generalization can be found in small family groups. Lycanthropes often go all crazy with rage and are a severe danger to their families and friends. A loved one pushed nearly to death by the rampages of a wererat is rather likely to spurn the creature which transformed it, running off and ultimately forming a new &quot;culture&quot; of one. However, it is not unheard of for such a victim to stay on and create a pack of lycanthropes. These groups tend to avoid contact with humans and supernaturals alike and have strange views.</p>
<p>Lycanthropes take aggravated damage from silver weapons and are weakened by alcohol, which also tends to make them even more unstable and prone to frenzy. All types of Lycanthrope have a Lunar power source. Most Lycanthropes are subject to Master Passion Rage, which leads them to sometimes go berserk when the moon rises. Lycanthropes of all kinds are well-advised to avoid fragile things and people.</p>

<p>The word &quot;lycanthrope&quot; literally comes from Greek words for &quot;wolf&quot; and &quot;form&quot;, but it is an English word that means &quot;a human who transforms into a wolf <em>or other beast</em>&quot;. Many people will try to get you to use the word &quot;Therianthrope&quot; or &quot;Zoanthrope&quot; in an attempt to use Greek root words correctly, but those words are not commonly used in English. Of course, as with all aspects of this work you may change whatever you wish to suit your particular needs or predilections.</p>

<h3 id="werewolves"><a class="header" href="#werewolves">Werewolves</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;The better to eat you with, my dear.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Somewhere in the howling wilderness of Scandinavia, a &quot;wolf warrior&quot; of the North became darkly fused with a wolf pelt he was wearing while fighting the Huns. That places the creation of the Werewolf at approximately 600 CE. Passed on to enemies and conquered victims, the curse spread throughout the lands of Europe and beyond along the warpaths of the Huns and Vikings. In later nights, the curse spread throughout the world on the backs of European conquistadors and imperial marines. By the Thirteenth Century it had spread as far as Central Asia, and Wolf Mother Asena led the Syndicate of the Bumin Horde of Ergenekon to rule much of Eurasia until her presumed death and the dissolution of the Syndicate in 1844.</p>
<p>Werewolves are instilled with a love of combat and destruction even when in human forms. In their monstrous forms, they take the shape of awkwardly toothy man-wolves. Glistening with drool and usually splattered with blood, the claws and fangs of a monstrous formed werewolf are a terror. Every Werewolf can transform into a &quot;regular&quot; canine as well as a huge canid beast. Not all Werewolves transform into an actual wolf when they become a mundane animal; for whatever reason, some become dogs, coyotes, foxes, jackals, or even hyenas.</p>
<p>Though they gain no magical power or sustenance from it, Werewolves are drawn to eating human flesh and will often succumb to this temptation while in a frenzy. The curse of Lycanthropy comes with unusual and often unwanted hair growth on various parts of the body for Werewolves. In the era of waxing and depilatories, a Werewolf can keep this under control, but changing into the War Form causes hair to come back no matter what has been done. On the plus side: baldness is curable through infection with Lycanthropy.</p>
<p>Werewolves have an Astral power source and a Lunar power schedule. As Lycanthropes, they are vulnerable to silver and weakened by alcohol.</p>
<h4 id="the-first-werewolf"><a class="header" href="#the-first-werewolf">The First Werewolf?</a></h4>
<p>The secret histories are comparatively clear about the source of the canine form of Lycanthropy. There was a Norse warrior at the beginning of the 7th century who got cursed, and every single Werewolf in the whole world traces their condition back to him. However, while this story is well-documented and has a lot of evidence behind it, there are still those who insist that there were earlier Werewolves or that canine Lycanthropy has occurred more than once. In particular, several secret historians hold that the myth of Romulus and Remus refers to a Werewolf cult that founded the Roman kingdom. The exact mechanics of the wolf pelt curse are unknown to modern sorcery, so it is within the realm of possibility that it could happen again. Or that it already has.</p>

<p><em>&quot;Tear him up.&quot;</em></p>
<p>The most frequently told story of the origins of the plague of the Nezumi is that someone turned their back on the teachings of the Buddha and was cursed with reincarnating in a lower form during their own life. If even partially true, this would mean that the plague started no earlier than about 500 BCE. Once afflicted, a Nezumi Lycanthrope begins to twitch their nose like Elizabeth Montgomery and click their tongues nervously.</p>
<p>A Nezumi's animal form is that of a large rat. Nezumi are immune to the effects of disease, but carry virtually every disease they come into contact with. Unlike other lycanthropes, Nezumi have no monstrous war form, though nothing is stopping them from eventually learning one, and some certainly do. While most Nezumi lack the brutal jaws or rending claws of other lycanthropes, their bites are still often quite deadly because of the pestilence they carry. Still, it is important to note that even their animal form is of little help in a fight, being as it is just a large rat.</p>
<p>Most Nezumi are mastered by the same all-consuming rage of the other Lycanthropes. However, they <em>don't</em> normally possess any great strength, a fact which frequently causes them to become quite cowardly and fearful of authority. Many Nezumi become quite resigned from the world: hiding in sewers, jumping at sounds; knowing that the heat of battle runs in their veins, and feeling dreadfully afraid that it will eventually drive them to a suicidal battle over nothing. Interacting with the world of men seems to be a never-ending river of frustrations, and many choose to simply not do it. Those who master their rage usually do so only by trading it for Master Passion Fear.</p>
<p>A Nezumi has an Infernal power source and a Lunar power schedule. As Lycanthropes, they are vulnerable to silver and weakened by alcohol.</p>
<h4 id="the-first-nezumi"><a class="header" href="#the-first-nezumi">The First Nezumi?</a></h4>
<p>Opinions are divided as to the historicity of the Buddha offending story in the secret histories. The oldest <em>living</em> Nezumi is Hamamoto Yoshi, who was born in the 8th century CE in Nagaokyo, Japan and now lives in cryptic hermitude in Kyoto's sewers. Most Nezumi die of old age, and when Yoshi has deigned to answer such questions at all, he has denied being the first.</p>

<p><em>&quot;You can fool everybody, but landie, dearie me, you can't fool a cat. They seem to know who's not right.&quot;</em></p>
<p>The legends say that the Bagheera were formed first by a jaguar warrior pledged to Huitzilopochtli that stalked the jungles and mountains like Death itself taken shape. They also say that a Bengali priestess was the first, blessed by Shiva to bring destruction to her enemies. When consulted on the subject directly, the Stellar Oracles enigmatically state that both stories are true. Regardless, once infected a Bagheera is a creature of death and finds that their mere presence alarms and angers animals of all types, especially cats.</p>
<p>A Bagheera's War Form is that of a great and ghostly cat. Perhaps a tiger, jaguar, or leopard. Most Bagheera cannot transform into a remotely reasonably sized cat that can pass as something &quot;not terrifying.&quot; It has been suggested that the beast inside a Bagheera isn't really an animal at all, since they seem to show less than no affinity for the mundane beasts they appear as - a marked departure from other Lycanthropes.</p>

<h4 id="the-first-bagheera"><a class="header" href="#the-first-bagheera">The First Bagheera</a></h4>
<p>The origins of the Bagheera are clouded in mystery. Like the Camazotz most, records of their history were lost during the genocidal conquest of South America. The modern Bagheera take their name from a separate tradition in which a Bengali priestess called upon her gods and goddesses to allow her to smite the spreading Islamic culture in the 1300s, but the Bagheera of the False Face were likely a much older line than that.</p>

<p><em>&quot;Time is an abyss. Profound as a thousand nights... Centuries come and go... To be unable to grow old is terrible. Death is not the worst... There are things more horrible than death. Can you imagine... Enduring centuries... experiencing each day with the same futile things?&quot;</em></p>
<p>Vampirism is passed from one person to the next voluntarily on the part of the Vampire passing on the trait. The Vampire drinks the blood of the victim until it is gone and puts some of their own blood into the dying victim's mouth. Vampires drink the blood of the living to maintain their existence as the living dead night after night for as long as the Earth continues to turn.</p>
<p>How you can tell someone is a vampire varies from story to story. These differences are the primary way we differentiate different types of Vampire in this game as the primary marker of bloodlines. Various games and book series have at times attempted to differentiate vampires on other criteria as well (such as the amount of sparkling they do or how long they can be played as characters before they go crazy), but this has not been overly successful. So we're recognizing a few common and three variable ways to detect vampires. All vampires are the living dead, so their body temperature is below that of a living human even if they have recently eaten. Also, their blood doesn't move around their body at the behest of a pumping heart, so they have no detectable heartbeat and their wounds don't bleed. Beyond that, they can be detectable by a few means that vary by vampiric &quot;type&quot;: the Nosferatu are hideous, the Camazotz are beautiful but have distinct animal traits, and the Strigoi are obsessed with various details and trivialities.</p>
<p>All vampires drink blood to regain Magic Points, and all vampires can at least potentially live forever. In After Sundown, it is this facility with <em>not dying</em> that most effectively defines a vampire. So long as they keep draining life from others, their unlife need never end. Any vampire can sprout teeth sufficient to pierce the toughest arteries on a victim. A Camazotz can produce fangs like a vampire bat, a Strigoi can exude serpent-like fangs, and the teeth of a Nosferatu are as ghastly and varied as the imagination can allow.</p>
<p>Vampires suffer aggravated damage from wood, and most of them have Master Passion Hunger. Every subtype of Vampire has a Feeding Power Schedule. As undead, they are weakened by sunlight. Most have little problem going about in the day, but a few develop what is effectively an allergy or oversensitivity to bright lights in general. Vampires are created by another vampire draining the life out of a Luminary and then passing the corpse a Magic Point with The Blood is the Life before the body has become cool. They can <em>attempt</em> this process with Extras, but the result is always disappointment and the creation of a near mindless Vampire Spawn. A victim whose lifeblood is drained to the point of death and then allowed to cool <em>without</em> being fed a Magic Point is simply dead.</p>
<h3 id="the-nosferatu-grotesques-of-the-imagination"><a class="header" href="#the-nosferatu-grotesques-of-the-imagination">The Nosferatu: Grotesques of the Imagination</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;That fate which condemns me to wallow in blood has also denied me the joys of the flesh. This face - the infection which poisons our love. This face which earned a mother's fear and loathing, a mask: my first unfeeling scrap of clothing. Pity comes too late, turn around and face your fate, an eternity of <strong>this</strong> before your eyes!&quot;</em></p>
<p>Nosferatu are social pariahs. Many of them look monstrous, animalistic, or deformed. While others look reasonably human, there is a certain otherworldly air about them that frightens small children. Any human who sees a Nosferatu's face will be instantly convinced that they are dealing with something monstrous. Young women will recoil, priests will present crosses, that kind of thing.</p>
<p>The Nosferatu are considered great information brokers by other supernaturals, and this is not an unreasonable assumption, as Nosferatu can pass unseen in all but the most observant company. Upon transforming into a Nosferatu, a character gains a specific monstrous caste to their appearance. Some are lucky enough to have a face that can pass for a human that happens to be forbiddingly cruel-looking, while others look like nothing so much as rabid beasts. Whether subtle or complete, the Nosferatu's appearance is morphed by the time they first open their eyes as a vampire. Nosferatu that persist for many nights sometimes find themselves gradually transforming into forms yet more monstrous.</p>
<p>Each Nosferatu's feeding maw is unique. One might protrude a mosquito's proboscis while another might extend a lamprey's wheel of teeth or a leech's beak. There is no guaranty that a newly created Nosferatu will have a method of feeding that is the same or in any way less disgusting than their sire's.</p>
<p>A Nosferatu has an Astral power source and a Feeding power schedule. As undead, they are vulnerable to wood and weakened by sunlight.</p>

<p>The secret histories abound with unidentified bogie men and monsters of the night. Nosferatu are only first called out as such in the 6th century with Krampus the Child Eater of what is now Northern Austria. With their natural abilities to hide from notice and their proclivities for avoiding social situations, it is generally unknown how long Nosferatu have skulked in the night.</p>

<p><em>&quot;A weapon you don't have in your hand will not kill a snake.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Elegant and sophisticated or possibly simply old-fashioned and resistant to change, the Strigoi are the aristocratic Vampire of legend. The Strigoi have a long tradition of being in control in Eastern Europe. Traditionally, the Strigoi only transform people who are already rich, powerful, or socially connected. The transformation preserves the Strigoi's physical bodies against the ravages of sickness, hunger, and time, and even enhances their physical power. But immortality and power do not come without a cost, for the Strigoi must feed on the living. Strigoi regain power by drinking the blood of humans, and if they don't consume blood regularly, they are driven mad with hunger and pain.</p>
<p>While they present themselves as genteel, the Strigoi are serpents. Not just in that they lie, but that they have retractable poisonous fangs and cold blood like a snake. Some Strigoi have their eyes change to snakelike yellow slitted affairs when their fangs come out. Strigoi are also inherently obsessive. Despite their healthy and timeless appearance, Strigoi are dead; and they will often display a strong aversion to certain things which remind them of their human lives, although such aversion is by no means consistent between individuals. Individual Strigoi usually display some symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder, such as counting, cleaning, and otherwise ritualizing their lives.</p>
<p>The Strigoi and Nosferatu have a checkered history, with the Strigoi usually holding the upper hand. Strigoi lands were usually farther to the South into what is now the Balkans, but in those areas where both existed, the Strigoi recruited from the top of society and the Nosferatu from the bottom. These social class differences persisted in the night as they did in the day.</p>
<p>A Strigoi has an Orphic power source and a Feeding power schedule. As undead, they are vulnerable to wood and weakened by sunlight.</p>
<h4 id="the-first-strigoi"><a class="header" href="#the-first-strigoi">The First Strigoi?</a></h4>
<p>By far the most famous Strigoi was (is?) Dracula. He is rather hated by most Strigoi because his obsessive grandstanding over the years is a giant thumb in the eye of the Vow of Silence. He's been killed repeatedly, but various fanatics keep figuring out ways to bring him back from the dead. Which being a Strigoi mostly involves finding some significant portion of his corpse and pouring a bunch of fresh human blood on it.</p>
<p>But Strigoi were running around being aristocratic blood drinkers for over two thousand years before Dracula was a major player in the Makhzen-Covenant wars of the 15th century. The first Strigoi in the secret histories is Zalmoxis, who was a god-king of the Dacians in the 12th century BCE. He enslaved other supernatural creatures and taught humans about Orphic magic. The secret histories are a little unclear on what exactly he did because shortly after he was defeated the Tradition of Misdirection was created to prevent as much actionable sorcerous knowledge from falling into the hands of mortal humans as Zalmoxis had allowed.</p>

<p><em>&quot;It turns out that humans <strong>in general</strong> are a superstitious and cowardly lot. How marvelous.&quot;</em></p>
<p>So thoroughly has the American Vampire integrated itself into vampire lore that it is difficult for us to remember that before contact was established between the New World and the Old that the bat vampire was a being only of the Americas (as indeed, Vampire Bats themselves are a New World creature). The Camazotz were also called Onaqui and Tlahuelpuchi by the Nahuatl speakers of Central America, but they are named as demons in whispered tones by mortals and supernaturals alike. Seemingly before 1492, not a single one of them set foot in Africa or Eurasia. And yet, in the most recent centuries, they have spread throughout the World, and transformed Luminaries of every skin tone into more of themselves.</p>
<p>Camazotz are vampires with an affinity for bats and fire. The Camazotz do not burn, and small bat wings protrude from their backs. Some of them have spots like a jaguar on their arms or legs. All of them have very sharp teeth with an uncanny resemblance to a vampire bat. A Camazotz's distinguishing features can often be relatively easy to hide. Wearing a backpack or even a heavy jacket covers wings quite nicely, and teeth can be covered or passed off as an affected body modification. However, once discovered, a Camazotz's animalistic, even <em>demonic</em> traits are difficult to explain away as anything short of an extreme breach of the Vow of Silence.</p>
<p>The eldest of the Camazotz represented much of the power behind The False Face when it considered itself a Syndicate, before the war with the Covenant. Tonight, Camazotz are members of every Syndicate. Looking at the demographics of Camazotz tonight, it would hardly occur to an observer that just five hundred years ago every Camazotz on the planet was Native American.</p>
<p>A Camazotz has an Infernal power source and a Feeding power schedule. As undead they are vulnerable to wood and weakened by sunlight.</p>
<h4 id="the-first-camazotz"><a class="header" href="#the-first-camazotz">The First Camazotz?</a></h4>
<p>The mythical origins of the False Face and the bloodline of the Camazotz are lost even to the secret histories. Various Mayan codices that survived in the private collections of pre-Columbia monsters speak of legends that predate history when bat-winged rulers lorded over the entire continent in the earliest days of human settlement in South America, but even such incunabula date much later than the probable origin of the Hunters in the Night.</p>

<p><em>&quot;It's not all hocus pocus and chicanery. There's also sleight of hand and deceit. And raw sorcerous power.&quot;</em></p>
<p>The core of sorcery in a horror setting is that it's a series of secrets that an individual learns that gives them great powers and is a really bad idea. When Extras attempt to learn magic, they don't turn into monsters or anything but just end up as cultists. Think Cthulhu or Bible Black cultists. Better yet, don't. Extras who attempt to learn magic usually end up getting sacrificed one way or another, and it's no better than being a Vampire Spawn. But for those lucky few who can master the dark arts without succumbing to the whispers or tentacles of demons, a lifetime of sorcerous power and intrigue awaits.</p>
<p>Using magic is, for a mortal, a harrowing, draining, and indeed life and sanity threatening thing. However, through deliberate study or horrid inspiration, a human can manage to change themselves into something that <em>can</em> use magic with relative safety and reliability. Once attuned to sorcery a soul can never be the same, and people who become sorcerers can be hard to get along with or even <em>understand</em>. What they have in common is a desire for power so strong it drives them to destroy their souls.</p>
<p>Most Witches are usually fairly vulnerable to normal physical attacks, but silver causes them aggravated damage. Witches are also weakened by simply getting wet, so most of them have peculiar or even paranoid washing behaviors. Witches tend toward Master Passion Greed, a less controlled form of the drive for power that brought them to sorcery in the first place. In After Sundown, men and women can both be &quot;Witches&quot;, although some men prefer the epithet &quot;Warlocks&quot; and a considerable number prefer to call themselves by some more culturally specific term for a magician such as Houngan or Rishi.</p>
<p>Otherwise, Witches are a special case of supernatural, because the biggest thing they have in common is that they have learned some Sorcery, but beyond that, they differ a great deal depending on what they learned and how. Each type of witch has just a few powers in common and much greater flexibility to determine their starting power set compared to other supernatural creatures. The one thing that's harder to do is to turn one into a pure physical combat monster, but the Khaibit has a decent shot at it.</p>

<p><em>&quot;I'll show them, I'll show them all!&quot;</em></p>
<p>You have to want power pretty badly to become a sorcerer, but not everyone that becomes a sorcerer was originally looking into traditional mystical sources for that power. It's entirely possible to start out with the trappings of science and those trappings continue to work quite well, no matter how much the hoary old traditionalists shake their heads about it. It's just that the sort of things you have to do are not the sort approved of by institutional review boards. You have to dig into things that are disreputable and start experimenting on yourself. Once the breakthrough scars your soul the supernatural world will group you with the Witches just the same.</p>
<p>Dr. Victor Frankenstein could easily be interpreted as a Khaibit: having picked up a morbid obsession after the death of his mother, he proceeds to experiment with Reanimation until he creates a new living creature, with the only extra detail required being an accidental death and resurrection during his chemical experiments in Ingolstadt.</p>

<p><em>&quot;You will not remember what I show you now, and yet I shall awaken memories of love... and crime... and death...&quot;</em></p>
<p>Perhaps the most expedient manner to make one's human soul stop reacting poorly to magic is to set it on fire and be done with it. A Baali is someone who did exactly that. Some sell their soul off to demons, while others burn out their souls quickly or slowly by dabbling in dark power. Infernal grimoires have over-elaborate rites to get the job done one way or another. Baali may delve into any infernal Discipline, but some direct power over others is always their first birthright.</p>
<p>Baali tend to be emotionally distant and enraged by pictures of themselves (such as reflections, paintings, or photographs). This is probably to do with the fact that their souls are burned out husks or trapped far away in a mysterious hell dimension and reminders of their pasts as humans are infuriating. The thing where they usually fail at having normal relationships with people is probably much the same, albeit played out in a grinding process of ashy distance rather than inexplicable rage.</p>
<p>Baali refresh their powers by hurting people. This is functionally equivalent to vampiric blood-drinking, but they don't specifically put any blood into their mouths. They still have to spend the same amount of time absorbing the proceeds of their wickedness and have to inflict lethal wounds in the process; in the olden days, it was perfectly acceptable to sacrifice people on alters for a full charge-up and some Baali still try to get away with it. The range is limited to about one meter per Potency, but the flow of power can't be seen or observed in any way without Aura Perception.</p>
<p>The Baali Witch has an Infernal power source and a Feeding power schedule. As Witches, they are vulnerable to silver and weakened by water.</p>
<h4 id="the-first-baali"><a class="header" href="#the-first-baali">The First Baali?</a></h4>
<p>The word &quot;Baali&quot; is an old Mesopotamian word meaning someone worthy of respect or allegiance. It has been handed around the Middle East and North Africa for millennia, and even such famous figures as Hanni_bal_ have reference to precisely that in their names. But the title used to mean someone who used Sorcery. That changed with the reforms of Hammurabi in the 18th century BCE, where people who had no magic at all could be known as a Baal. The first person in the secret histories who used Infernal magic to burn out their soul to keep the use of magic from destroying them was Marduk. He slew Tiamat and began the Marduk Society in the 25th century BCE. It is interesting to note that in the nights since, the Marduk Society has moved to favor Astral magic, and no longer has many Baali members.</p>

<h3 id="mekhashfim-poisoners-of-souls"><a class="header" href="#mekhashfim-poisoners-of-souls">Mekhashfim: Poisoners of Souls</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;There are poisons that blind you, and poisons that open your eyes.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Sometimes those drugs that are supposed to rip open the doors of perception work for people. They see things mortals were not meant to know, and in turn, these things have a look inside them and ruin their souls just like the PSAs say they will. The upside, though, is that these mutilated souls and their (metaphorically) gaping third eyes are now great channels for the evil power of nightmare to come through. Non-Luminaries that try this end up as addled husks, but Mekhashfim manage to hold it together. Mostly.</p>
<p>There are various ways of getting to this point. Those psychonauts of a scientific bent may have little experience with the supernatural beforehand and simply stumble through the veil of reality by accident. Others may be guided on a mystic path with all due ceremony before drinking the potion that initiates them to the mysteries. And sometimes alchemists just find that the culmination of their Great Work to perfect the soul involves absorbing more mercury fumes than the brain can handle. Any Astral path may come to them, but they all have a facility with drugs and potions that is remarkable to witness.</p>
<p>The Mekhashfim ritual to regain Magic Points usually involves taking more psychoactive substances. Any radical ecstatic practice could work, and some grimoires, like the King in Yellow, manage to fuck you up so badly just by reading them that the effect is much the same, but each Mekhashef has their particular vice that they must always return to. The resulting lotus-eater fugue state lasts for a few hours in any case.</p>

<p>There have probably been Mekhashfim as long as there have been Luminary shamans that were willing to do eat dubious mushrooms to gain power over the supernatural, but few of their methods survived to be recorded after the dawn of history. The secret histories note that the Eleusinian Mysteries had been established and started actively initiating members around 650 BCE, but the name Mekhashfim wasn't settled on until a few centuries later by a group of refugee witches displaced from around the Mediterranean who took it on as a reminder of the price of publicity.</p>

<h3 id="khaibit-traffickers-in-death"><a class="header" href="#khaibit-traffickers-in-death">Khaibit: Traffickers in Death</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;There are far worse things awaiting man than death.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Fear of darkness and death leads men to do strange things. Perhaps the strangest of them is to murder one's self and then use sorcery or advanced medical techniques to make one's foray into the land of the dead a temporary one. This does not inherently prevent a person from dying in the future, indeed quite the opposite. Many who gain the intimate secrets of death in this manner are chased by the shadow of doom for the remainder of their existence, but their dead souls have no trouble manipulating the power of the Gloom. Having opened the Gates of Death they all have some power over Ghosts and Zombies, but all Orphic Disciplines are open to them.</p>
<p>The Khaibit Ritual to regain power requires <em>either</em> a bunch of medical equipment <em>or</em> a bunch of corpse pieces, depending upon whether they originally killed themselves with scientific equipment or ancient rituals. That declaration needs to be made right at the beginning of character creation. However, while the more mystical types need to have a skull to &quot;Alas Poor Yorick&quot; with, it doesn't need to be especially fresh and they don't need to have chopped it off themselves and an Orphic Grimoire counts too. Either way, Khaibit are incredibly bad tenants, as some sort of horrible luck rubs off onto any place they stay for long. Appliances break down, walls cave in, windows break. Many Khaibit become paranoid about these effects, and come to believe that a mysterious force is hunting them to take them back to The Gloom. They might even be right.</p>
<p>The Khaibit Witch has an Orphic power source and a Ritual power schedule. As Witches, they are vulnerable to silver and weakened by water.</p>
<h4 id="the-first-khaibit"><a class="header" href="#the-first-khaibit">The First Khaibit?</a></h4>
<p>Khaibit Sorcery is available throughout the night all over the world. The earliest recorded books of power written for the subject were in Egypt around 1550 BCE. The &quot;Book of the Dead&quot; was itself based on earlier sorcerous investigations, but Khaibit Witches date back in a currently recognizable form to the beginnings of the Middle Kingdom in Egypt.</p>

<p><em>&quot;Down and deep / dark and dank / below our feet / below they sank<br />
Under waves and / under ground / no light we have / no hope for sound<br />
Beneath us still / sea and mound / remember will / with silence found&quot;</em></p>
<p>Long ago, Tiamat was a great and monstrous goddess who ruled over the lands and exercised her rights of ownership with great cruelty. She demanded sacrifices from the frightened people of the soil, and she bore many monsters to expand her kingdom. The oppression of Tiamat did not forever last, for eventually a great champion of the human people arose with powerful magic from the sky to battle her. For days they fought, and ultimately it was Marduk and not Tiamat who was victorious.</p>
<p>But while the great Tiamat was slain, her children walked the Earth and swam the seas still. Each of her children bore children of their own. Many of these were able to pass for human and walk in the world of men, and still, many more were monstrous beyond mortal comprehension. The taint in the blood of those who are heirs to the power of Tiamat gradually makes itself known. These new generations, called Leviathan, become less human in countenance and thought as they grow in age and power. Their strange habits of mind draw them closer to alien worlds than most.</p>
<p>Tiamat's descendants are foul-tasting as swamp mire, but they are prized as food regardless because whosoever devours the flesh of a Leviathan gains immortality. However, the otherworldly and inhuman degeneration which happens to a natural-born Leviathan happens twice as fast to those who attain their state by eating the flesh of mermaids.</p>
<p>Those born to Leviathan broods who are not luminaries will (if they are lucky) never betray their leviathan heritage, appearing for all the world as normal humans (though perhaps with a strange bestial cast to their features). These leviathan kin carry Tiamat's taint, and if they have children of their own they may revert to being full leviathans should they be luminaries themselves. Other children are not so lucky, and many of them are pathetic spawn monsters, often with little or no human intelligence. The mutated visages of humanity’s castoffs make ample fodder for nightmares, and little else.</p>
<p>Leviathans suffer aggravated damage from Iron. Most Leviathans suffer under Master Passion Fear and it is not unusual at all for them to flee from the world and hide deep in the wilderness in fortresses of their own making. Some of these are simply humble farmsteads, whose only &quot;real&quot; defense from the outside world is obscurity.</p>
<h3 id="the-deep-ones-scions-of-dagon"><a class="header" href="#the-deep-ones-scions-of-dagon">The Deep Ones: Scions of Dagon</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;Those horrible eyes. Unblinking and inhuman, twas like looking at fish more than a man.&quot;</em></p>
<p>According to legend, Dagon was spawned when Tiamat mated with the Tigris River. He was a powerful and fish-like creature, and his progeny all carry fish traits about their being. Hailing from the oceans, a Deep One gradually becomes scaled and gilled as he ages. His eyes flatten and rarely blink, and the lure of the sea becomes harder to ignore. Few can stomach long departures from the coast, for in their mind they can always listen for the strange whispered yet incessant call of the ocean.</p>
<p>Deep Ones can breathe water as easily as air (though they do not <em>need</em> to breathe at all), and they have no problem speaking with lungs full of fluid. The strange whispers they hear in their own minds can also be shared with anyone foolish enough to look a Deep One in their strangely opaque eyes. Over time, the Deep One's teeth become sharp like some benthic terror and their skin becomes scaly and slimy like a muck dwelling fish.</p>
<p>Deep Ones are in many ways closer to Tiamat than other Leviathans, and the corruption she caused is manifest in the way they seem to affect the world. Ordinary people who spend long periods in the company of Deep Ones will find their sanity frayed at the edges like cloth stretched too tight. A Deep One gripped by Master Passion Fear spreads terror amongst the mortal Extras they converse with, whether they want to or not. Deep Ones dominated by other Master Passions spread different madness by mere presence.</p>
<p>A Deep One has an Astral power source and a Lunar power schedule. As Leviathan they are vulnerable to iron and weakened by sunlight.</p>
<h4 id="the-first-deep-one"><a class="header" href="#the-first-deep-one">The First Deep One?</a></h4>
<p>The secret histories record the first Deep One by name. He is Dagon, the first and largest of the Deep Ones. Accounts differ as to his appearance, but all attest to his great size and blue scales. While some historians doubt the veracity of the Dagon myth, the majority of those who study the Deep Ones regard it as true. The general opinion is that Dagon is still alive, lurking and dreaming deep beneath the waves. Sometimes one of the progeny will be contacted in their dreams by an Elder that claims to be Dagon, and the general opinion of Deep Ones is that those contacts are real. The requests that the putative Dagon makes are perplexing and do not seem to add up. Opinions are divided as to whether this entity is playing a far deeper game or is simply completely out of touch with reality.</p>
<p>If the Dagon story is true, he would have been born somewhere between 3 and 5 <em>thousand</em> years BCE. That would make him ancient beyond reckoning even by the standards of Elders.</p>

<p><em>&quot;Thousands of years we have toiled beneath the Earth. We will not stop just because shiftless Eloi tell us we must.&quot;</em></p>
<p>The ancient tablets speak of Drakaina, Tiamat's heir by the Euphrates. A terrible worm creature living deep in the soil, her descendants carry always her pallor and disdain for the sun. The eyes of a Troglodyte darken until they are naught but obsidian orbs in their pallid sockets. The fingernails of a Troglodyte grow rapidly and hard, and without constant hygiene, they form into claws.</p>
<p>Troglodytes see in darkness perfectly and can even read in the total absence of light. However, their blackened eyes are light-sensitive, and bright flashes can easily blind a Troglodyte. The sharpened teeth of a Troglodyte seem destined to devour flesh, and indeed that is precisely how they gain Magic Points. A Troglodyte needs to feed upon the flesh of sapient creatures (generally humans, but some Troglodytes say that Mirror Goblins are delicious), though these need not be particularly fresh. The corpse of a human has 15 Magic Points in it, and when they have been consumed, the rest of the corpse is worthless (though possibly still delicious). Many Troglodytes dig up the interred dead for eating purposes, and this activity has earned them the nickname &quot;ghouls&quot;.</p>
<p>A Troglodyte has an Orphic power source and a Feeding power schedule. As Leviathan they are vulnerable to iron and weakened by sunlight.</p>
<h4 id="the-first-troglodyte"><a class="header" href="#the-first-troglodyte">The First Troglodyte?</a></h4>
<p>The lineage of the Troglodytes goes back to the days of Babylon and likely before. The ancient worm-mother of the Troglodytes is likely a historical person, and some say that she yet lives. The secret histories claim that she burrowed deep beneath the surface world to found herself a new kingdom where the sun would never shine. This land beneath the land is not in contact with any surface dwellers - not even those Troglodytes who continue to see the stars.</p>

<h3 id="the-mi-go-the-larvae-of-echidna"><a class="header" href="#the-mi-go-the-larvae-of-echidna">The Mi Go: The Larvae of Echidna</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;There can never be good for the bee which is bad for the hive.&quot;</em></p>
<p>&quot;Tiamat begat Echidna by the Indus.&quot; That is the beginning of the story that the Mi Go tell of their existence. And it is there that the story becomes confused because the Mi Go <em>do not know what they are</em>. This isn't some sort of regular existential angst caused by awakening to their supernatural nature, but a genuine question of philosophy and science. Each Mi Go is a telepathic symbiosis of human and insect, and it is entirely reasonable to question which (if either) is the actual person. Even the eldest and wisest of the Mi Go do not have incontrovertible evidence to determine whether they are a human that has insects growing within their body that they can control, or a colony of insects that lives within a man-sized puppet host. Perhaps the truth is somewhere in between.</p>
<p>A Mi Go experiences their first years of life from the perspective of being a human child. A human child who sometimes feels painful gnawing sensations within their body as they drift to sleep and as they wake up in the morning - as if they were being devoured from within by maggots. Which in truth, they are. If you were to drill a hole in one of these children, you would find larval insects in writhing clusters throughout their body. It is usually around their human puberty that the insects themselves mature to flying forms and it is a ghastly, painful, and terrifying spectacle when the insects burrow their way out of the awakening Mi Go's body and take to the sky.</p>
<p>It is at this point that the Mi Go's powers truly become apparent because during the metamorphosis, the young Mi Go feels not only their flesh become torn asunder by uncounted scores of tiny mandibles, but also simultaneously see through the eyes of each of the hive's constituent members. From that moment on, &quot;they&quot; see through the eyes of the bugs that grow within the human body <em>and</em> from the eyes of the human body. They do not have a &quot;feeling&quot; of having their thoughts or point of view necessarily within their head, and many of them are convinced that they are solely the hive and have murdered and stolen the memories of the child that they walk around wearing the skin of. Getting insecticides onto a Mi Go has roughly the effects of mace - it's <em>incredibly</em> painful and distracting. The poisoning of the bugs inside their flesh <em>feels</em> like the entirety of their body is on fire.</p>
<p>A Mi Go has an Infernal power source and a Lunar power schedule. As Leviathan they are vulnerable to iron and weakened by sunlight.</p>
<h4 id="the-first-mi-go"><a class="header" href="#the-first-mi-go">The First Mi Go?</a></h4>
<p>The core question of identity is terribly important to many Mi Go, and finding the original being and asking it &quot;Why&quot; is one of the holy grails of Mi Go thought. According to the secret histories, Echidna flew into the Himalayan Mountains some four <em>thousand</em> years ago and has not been seen or heard from since. Many believe that she (they?) died during that journey. But there are many Mi Go who would kill to see even a corpse representing what form represents their destiny.</p>

<p><em>&quot;Once upon a time, there was... 'A king!' my little readers will say right away. No, children, you are wrong. Once upon a time there was a piece of wood...&quot;</em></p>
<p>Animates are different from the other types of supernaturals because they are not born as a human only to later achieve supernatural powers, but are instead created fully formed and fully grown with their powers already intrinsic to them. An Animate awakens for the first time already an outcast, already both more and less than a human. Animates are almost always rejected by humanity because regardless of how much they try, they are <em>not</em> humans. Every Animate is not only the first of its kind, it is also the <em>last</em> of its kind. Every Animate creation event is unique and Animates tragically find that even other created life is intrinsically <em>distinct</em> from them, different from humanity in ways which likewise reveal a difference that is just as unbridgeable.</p>
<p>Animates are capable of being Extras and Luminaries just as normal humans are. In general, a mad scientist's masterwork is a Luminary Animate (the kind that might be a player character), and a batch of killer robots is probably a bunch of Animate Spawn. This means that yes, those Animates who have peers don't even care because those are just background characters and mooks in their own story.</p>
<p>All Animates use a Ritual Power Schedule. As creatures of false life they suffer aggravated damage from wooden weapons as if they were undead. In most cases, Animates are dominated by Master Passion: Loneliness, a condition not unrelated to the fact that each Animate is literally without peers. They have more difficulty making emotional connections then virtually any other creature, and pine for the loss.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4 id="what-if-they-didnt-fuck-it-up"><a class="header" href="#what-if-they-didnt-fuck-it-up">What if they didn't fuck it up?</a></h4>
<p>Sometimes a relatively well-balanced mortal Luminary might <em>try</em>, but they have never succeeded in creating a Luminary Animate. Some think that animation of unliving matter is truly a form of <em>Mad</em> Science, and the sane are simply incapable of grasping it: you have to have a Master Passion to create new pseudo-life, and that very madness will inevitably result in an emotionally flawed person who is in turn subject to a Master Passion. A few of the more annoyingly esoteric occultists instead suggest that it works just fine and isn't even that uncommon; it's just that if a fairly normal and reasonably sane person managed to create a new person the result would just be another fairly normal, reasonably sane person, no different than the children born every day that were &quot;created&quot; by in vitro fertilization.</p>

<h4 id="created-bodies"><a class="header" href="#created-bodies">Created Bodies</a></h4>
<p>Many Animates are created out of human flesh. Sometimes it is as simple as cobbling together body parts and then harnessing lightning or mystic power to bring it to life. Sometimes they are grown in tanks like Hank and Dean. And in yet other methods of creation they are crafted in some other medium such as wood or stone and then <em>transformed</em> into human flesh. Regardless of the creation methodology, an Animate crafted of flesh is close enough to human in appearance to pass for one, albeit perhaps a very sick one. Other Animates can be made of circuitry, gears, or simply polished marble that never had anything like an organic life. Usually, these are crafted such that they approximate human appearance and can pass as human, while others are clearly artificial and mechanical in appearance and rely on Guise in order to go unnoticed. Mechanically, the real difference is that fleshy Animates have Restoration and solid or mechanical ones have Grotesque Aegis. </p>

<p>While the conventional Animate was created a blank-slate, others may have false memories implanted, either deliberately as a way to boot-strap their social abilities or accidentally as a part of the process of assembling the creation. While these memories will tend to ring false, they do provide a way to connect an Animate's story with that of a mortal character. This provides a way to have a kind of continuity for an Origin Story character whose player would like to play an Animate, which does not really have a magical transformation the way other playable types do. </p>

<p>Frankensteins are crafted to be new living things. They are essentially people, albeit designed rather than evolved. Unfortunately, the creators of these new creatures almost never take to their assumed role as a parent, because the Frankenstein is never truly a baby and never truly a human. Propelled into existence with a grown human's size and facilities, they nonetheless suffer from having missed the opportunities to be juvenile. Like a child forced to be a soldier or bride, a Frankenstein's life will always have deeply painful emotional issues. They will always be childlike in some aspects of their existence, even if they live to be hundreds of years old.</p>

<p>Created strong of body and unending in endurance, the Robot is made to do tasks that humans don't want to and to not bother anyone while doing them. Often these jobs are demeaning or dangerous, and it is no surprise that Robots rarely want to do the things that are asked of them. They are beneath the notice of their creators, like a tool that is not in use or a person of low social status. Robots often appear crude and even inhuman, having been created for physical functionality rather than social niceties. They are the type of Animate most likely to have artificial utilitarian bodies, but sorcerers have also been creating homunculus servants for millennia.</p>
<p>Luminary Robots have all the subjectivity and potential emotional complexity of any human, but the way they have been objectified has left them underdeveloped.

<p>Galateans are created from a selfish desire for a perfect lover. Whether man, woman, both, or neither, a Galatean is - or once was - beautiful beyond what normal humans are capable of. Unfortunately, the artificial perfection of their exterior belies a flawed emotional interior that makes interpersonal relationships miserable and difficult. The feelings of a Galtatean, though strongly felt, are simply too extreme and without nuance for others to relate to. To a normal, human individual the love of a Galtatean is as off-putting as their hatred.

<p><em>&quot;Think before you decide, I tell you! Do you want to be left as you are, or do you want your eyes and your soul to be blasted by a sight that would stagger the devil himself?&quot;</em></p>
<p>Knowledge and power do not come without a price, especially in the realm of horror. When one steps upon the path to power it is not long before the realization strikes that the person on that path is not the same person who took the first steps. Sometimes the point of no return is obvious and comes as a flash of insight. At other times it is only in retrospect and solemn reflection that one can see that there's little connection between the humanity of youth and the creature of the present. Transhumans do not have souls in the way that normal people do.</p>
<p>Transhumans have the easiest time convincing themselves that they are still the person that they used to be - still a mortal human with all the accompanying impetus and fragility. This is not true, and the sheer <em>plausibility</em> of that kind of self-delusion leads many into a constant roller-coaster of false hopes and crushing disappointments. On some level, normal people can sense it, and vague misgivings surround all dealings between a Transhuman and mortals. The moment the character attains their power they have become something more than a man, but they have also become something <em>less</em>, and it is this truth that all Transhumans must confront.</p>
<p>Transhumans suffer aggravated damage from Iron weapons, the very human achievement that propels them beyond their biological origins also turns on them with cruel finality. Most Transhumans are dominated by Master Passion Despair.</p>
<h3 id="the-reborn-second-chances-and-second-guesses"><a class="header" href="#the-reborn-second-chances-and-second-guesses">The Reborn: Second Chances and Second Guesses</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;Put your helmet on. I wouldn't want to scar your pretty face. Again.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Reincarnation happens in After Sundown. Not to everyone, not even to most people. But to <em>some</em> people. For whatever reason, <em>only</em> Luminaries can access past lives, and even then past lives only become accessible when they are exposed to great stress in the presence of magic. Why this happens or what the consequences of this are is a matter of intense debate amongst the supernatural communities. It is possible that only Luminaries <em>have</em> past lives, or even that Luminaries are Luminary <em>because</em> they have lived before.</p>
<p>How many lives a particular Reborn remembers is quite variable. Sometimes it is as few as one, while other Reborn remember snippets of dozens. It is undeniably true that the chances of a particular Reborn running into specific people they knew in a past life (either other Reborn or immortals who happened to be alive back then) are extremely high. Past lovers and rivals both are <em>very</em> likely to be encountered by a Reborn during their new life, leading as many to repeat their old mistakes as to fix their previous errors.</p>
<p>There are prophetic maps available that plot the likely eruptions of new Reborn, and there are more than a few supernatural creatures and organizations of supernatural creatures that take an active interest in such matters. The Makhzen and Marduk Society traditionally find the Reborn to be natural members and go to great lengths to recruit them. Reborn are interesting in that they can be successfully identified with prophetic writings and comparisons to ancient statues and paintings long before they actually develop any powers.</p>
<p>A Reborn has an Orphic power source and a Lunar power schedule. As Transhumans, they are vulnerable to iron and weakened by water.</p>
<h4 id="the-first-reborn"><a class="header" href="#the-first-reborn">The First Reborn?</a></h4>
<p>No Reborn is ever born (much less awakened) during the lifetime of one of their past lives. Furthermore, all past lives are truly <em>in the past</em>, and there are no future incarnations remembered by any Reborn. So it stands to reason that at the earliest, the first Reborn had to have been born a couple of generations after the first human. The earliest Reborn who is specifically listed in the secret histories is Krishna: a mighty Tamil warrior who lived around 670 BCE and who had at least one previous life as a sage.</p>

<h3 id="the-fallen-rising-from-the-ashes"><a class="header" href="#the-fallen-rising-from-the-ashes">The Fallen: Rising from the Ashes</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;There is only one thing worse in the world than to be talked about. And that is to not be talked about.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Those luminaries whose souls are scoured out to beyond the possibility of recognition by the harsh infernos of Limbo are left ageless shells, they are The Fallen. Sometimes a man can become so by coming into possession of some demonic trinket that slowly or calamitously steals away their existence. But more commonly this is the result of a child being stolen away into the Dark Reflection by mirror goblins to toil away in the edifices of the dark king. These changelings usually are worked to death, and never see home. But sometimes a luminary child will grow hard and strong, and bitter like long steeped tea. And they will someday find a way to escape their soot-covered prison and return triumphantly to their parents, to be clasped again by loving hands and to walk again amongst mothers and friends. But this is perhaps the cruelest aspect of fairy captivity, for the children so taken are not long sought after for powerful magics are wrought to remove the Fallen from the thoughts of those who care for them. It is an alienating experience for those lucky enough to escape servitude back to the mortal world - while the family they remember like as not still exists, it is rare indeed that this family has any familiarity with them in return.</p>
<p>The Fallen do not have an internal source of magical power, but their bodies have become attuned to the ghastly magic of the Dark Reflection, and they can charge themselves up by exposing themselves to more Infernal energies. The Ritual to regain Magic Points requires exposure to something from Limbo. Those who were transformed by an Infernal artifact are well-advised to keep their hands firmly upon it. Those who escape the demonic realm usually carry something with them to recharge themselves with, though of course, simply <em>returning</em> to the Dark Reflection is always an option.</p>
<p>The very fact that a Fallen's magic powers do not come back without exposure to more of the evil magic that caused their condition in the first place has led some to speculate that if they were to simply avoid Infernal power long enough that they would regain their human lives. If anyone has succeeded in that, there are no reliable records of it. This is in a sense unsurprising, in that there are very few reliable records of Fallen. Not only are Fallen simply unmemorable to Extras, but even documents about them just &quot;get lost&quot;. And it isn't merely that their rental contracts get accidentally thrown out, though that does happen. Fallen often find copies of old yearbooks that simply don't contain any pictures of them.</p>

<h4 id="the-first-fallen"><a class="header" href="#the-first-fallen">The First Fallen?</a></h4>
<p>The King with Three Shadows has only been kidnapping mortal children since &quot;the project&quot; began in the 6th century CE. While the Troll Kingdoms had human slaves a thousand years before that, that practice ended when they were banished to Limbo, and human slaves in the mortal world did not become Fallen. The earliest Fallen in the secret histories is a Central African Queen of the 3rd century BCE who went by &quot;She Who Shall Not Be Named&quot; - likely because the process of becoming Fallen had stripped her of her original name. Supposedly she had a sacred flame that granted immortality. What happened to the Queen, her kingdom, or the presumably Limbo-powered flame is a matter of speculation even amongst those who know the secret histories. The last contact with any of them came with a trading expedition from Egypt in 476 CE.</p>

<h3 id="the-icarids-children-of-daedalus"><a class="header" href="#the-icarids-children-of-daedalus">The Icarids: Children of Daedalus</a></h3>
<p>&quot;<em>There are things man was not meant to know. It is interesting that we repeatedly seek to know as much about these as possible.</em>&quot;</p>
<p>Humanity’s greatest survival trait, indeed the one which has ensured our ascent to power, is a willingness and ability to improve upon our environment - the closest environment being our own flesh and bones. The desire to gain greater abilities overwhelms all else sometimes; even personal ethics, self-preservation, and basic sanity. Man is first and foremost a tool-using creature, but when he treats himself as a tool, is he still a man?</p>
<p>The Icarids are born when a Luminary is subject to the (nominally successful) experiments of scientists and practitioners of medicine to improve the human form beyond what it already has. Usually, this Luminary is both subject and creator of the experiment. They rarely have any familiarity or experience with the supernatural beforehand, and simply stumble through the veil of normality by &quot;accident&quot;. The transformational event bestows efficiency and power on the human form and mind that brings it beyond mortal limitations, including impressive strength and will - at the cost of sanity and self.</p>
<p>The drugs or procedures done to bring an Icarid to the point they are no longer human aren't just unwise - they're <em>lethal</em>. If you did that to an Extra they'd just die. It is in no small part the strength of the Luminary's dreams that force them onward through certain death and into power and madness. The ritual to regain Magic Points involves continuing to do more of the same to themselves. What's better than a lethal dose of mercury-based super serum? <em>More</em> mercury-based super serum. It is not at all weird for an Icarid who has been at it for a while to bleed clear liquid, sand, or even tiny grubs.</p>
<p>An Icarid has an Astral power source and a Ritual power schedule. As Transhumans they are vulnerable to iron and weakened by water.</p>
<h4 id="the-first-icarid"><a class="header" href="#the-first-icarid">The First Icarid?</a></h4>
<p>According to the secret histories, the first identified Icarids were the natural philosopher Daedalus and his son Icarus. They stumbled upon a humoral treatment based on goose bile and hot wax that would allow them to transcend human limitations in approximately 630 BCE. Icarus improved upon the treatment considerably and attained the aptitude of Flight. Icarus' experiments ended in tragedy when he flew over the ocean and a sudden rainstorm left him powerless. When he plunged into the sea, the pitiless waves crashed his nearly mortal body against the unforgiving cliffs until he was dead. In his grief, Daedalus named the process in honor of his son, but he still followed the Tradition of Misdirection, and reported the events somewhat differently to the humans of his time.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4 id="varied-icarids"><a class="header" href="#varied-icarids">Varied Icarids</a></h4>
<p>The Icarid starting powers tend to make them something of a generic übermensch with some Astral magic that reflects their tendency toward a Master Passion of Despair. There is instead a temptation to make them a less constrained type, like a Mad Science Witch. There's certainly nothing wrong with this, and it suits some inspirations much better, but since all In Medias Res characters get a free choice of two Basic and one Advanced power considerable customization is already available and it's easy to make the Invisible Man with Shadow Casting and Cloak of Darkness or have Mr. Hyde be a War Form or Monstrous Self. As always, the needs of a particular chronicle come first, and the rules may be changed to suit.</p>

<p><em>&quot;You seek for knowledge and wisdom, as I once did; and I ardently hope that the gratification of your wishes may not be a serpent to sting you, as mine has been.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Do you know who doesn't have emotionally crippling experiences when exposed to the true horrors of the world? Plants. A person who replaces their heart with a seed handle almost anything. Sometimes this is a deliberate process, and other times it is the providence of an evil seed taking control of someone in their sleep. Regardless, once a person's blood runs with sap they are forever a Dryad.</p>
<p>The Dryad transformation is a bit like that of a Lycanthrope. When a Luminary is implanted with a Mind Root and uses a Luck to just barely resist it taking them over the root can be subsumed into their body, leaving their mind a strange amalgam of human and the emotionless root system inhabiting them.</p>
<p>Dryads do not remember their dreams, even when woken in the middle of them. Their sweat smells like flowering trees. And they become plantish in their demeanor. Regaining their power requires that they put parts of their body into the ground and water themselves. When they draw their hands or feet out of the soil, there will momentarily be white rootlets that are rapidly drawn back into their pores with a sickening hiss.</p>
<p>Dryads most often have Master Passion Loneliness, representing their alienation from human emotion. A Dryad has an Astral power source and a Ritual power schedule. As a hybrid of a human and an Evil Plant they are vulnerable to iron and weakened by alcohol.</p>
<h4 id="the-first-dryad"><a class="header" href="#the-first-dryad">The First Dryad?</a></h4>
<p>Dryads seem to have first appeared during the Late Bronze Age collapse when the Fae lead massive invasions of Earth out of the Dreamlands and a plague of Evil Plants came with them, either hitching a ride or by some fey design. A slim handful of Luminaries around the world managed to break free of the Pods controlling them. Dryads were proscribed by the Makhzen for centuries, but diplomatic efforts by some of the first Mekhashfim to be called such resulted in the acceptance of Dryads into the fold. Despite all the centuries since many still regard Dryads as possible sleeper agents of the Evil Plants.</p>

<p>The Revenant is the talkative wight from virtually every piece of fiction where a Zombie is a major character. <em>Every</em> Luminary who becomes a Zombie by <em>whatever</em> means becomes a Revenant. Revenancy is curable, as can be seen from both <em>Scary Go Round</em> and <em>Army of Darkness</em>, and it is the only form of Zombie that is. A Revenant appears much as it did in life, save for pale white skin and darkness around the eyes. They look like someone who is wearing heavy goth makeup, save that there is something <em>obviously</em> unnatural about them that even the most casual observer can plainly see.</p>
<p>Revenants do not lose their reasoning faculties nor their personal moral compass. However, they <em>do</em> hunger for the brains of the living, and are doomed to gradually weaken and lose power until they devour such. Eating the brain of a human refreshes their Power batteries, but they <em>don't</em> have an unobtrusive or Vow of Silence upholding alternative at their disposal. Sooner or later, they <em>will</em> be compelled to break open a human skull and feast on the morsels inside. It is for this reason that even the usually quite open-minded supernatural societies would generally prefer that Revenants be cured or destroyed - their mere presence endangers the Vow of Silence more than most Syndicates are willing to condone. The fact that they can all also spread zombification doesn't help either, but sometimes they are accepted if they can demonstrate an ability to get by as ghoulish devourers of existing corpses.</p>
<p>Revenants are almost always subject to Master Passion Hunger. They have an Orphic power source and a Feeding power schedule. As undead they are vulnerable to wood and weakened by sunlight.</p>
<h4 id="the-first-revenant"><a class="header" href="#the-first-revenant">The First Revenant?</a></h4>
<p>By all reports, there have been zombies nearly as long as there have been humans, and Revenants have been involved in supernatural society from the beginning of the Makhzen. In the early centuries CE a few too many zombie outbreaks started rising the ire of more militant enforcers of the Vow of Silence, and accepted Revenants became something of a tolerated legacy so long as they didn't create more of their kind, their numbers slowly dwindling with time. It wasn't until the Communes started accepting them in the early 19th century - and making a corresponding fuss if their citizens weren't tolerated by the other Syndicates - that Revenants started to become a lasting part of the supernatural scene again.</p>

<p><em>That is a tragedy. You should probably kill it.</em></p>
<p>Supernaturals who aren't Luminaries are sad, monstrous things that have short life expectancies once the title sequence rolls. Not only do they have very limited supernatural powers but they are dominated by their Master Passion even more strongly than the true creatures they emulate. They suffer a -2 dicepool penalty when resisting or attempting to end a Frenzy. This penalty <em>rises</em> over time. Spawn who are weak of will are simply in frenzy <em>all the time</em>. As such, Spawn monsters don't have much success in society, and are frequently simply kept locked up to be released on main characters like guard dogs or bees (or twisted combinations of the two).</p>
<h3 id="lycanthrope-spawn-the-spawn-that-die"><a class="header" href="#lycanthrope-spawn-the-spawn-that-die">Lycanthrope Spawn: The Spawn that Die</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;Some experiences are literally once in a lifetime.&quot;</em></p>
<p>You don't see armies of Werewolves in After Sundown because Extras who undergo the transformation procedures <em>die</em>. And then they stay dead, and are dead. Sometimes they become ghosts and wander around haunting the lycanthropes that killed them <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082010/">American Werewolf in London</a> style, which is why so many Lycanthropes end up with the Haunted disadvantage.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it's often thought that Lycanthropes were first created by sorcerous rituals. Although no such rituals are known in the modern world, were they found or recreated in the modern nights they could create something like Lycanthrope spawn if used on Extras. Such unfortunates would have Master Passion Rage and a Lunar power schedule and would be expected to undergo an uncontrollable change into their War Form every time they frenzy or the full moon rises.</p>
<h3 id="vampire-spawn-thralls"><a class="header" href="#vampire-spawn-thralls">Vampire Spawn: Thralls</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;Back, I tell you all! This man belongs to me!&quot;</em></p>
<p>Vampire spawn are monstrous and depraved, hungering for the blood of mortals and generally making a nuisance of themselves. All Vampire Spawn have Master Passion Hunger and, like all spawn, they have difficulty controlling it. Vampire Spawn have only Patience of the Mountains and Revive the Flesh for their disciplines. There is little tangible difference between a Nosferatu Spawn and a Camazotz Spawn. Either could stand-in for the nameless mook vampires that can be killed even by Xander in a Buffy episode. They still get the Feeding power schedule, but they have a Potency of one that does not rise. Even hundreds of years later, taking down Dracula's clutch of bride thralls is not that much of a trick.</p>
<h3 id="animate-spawn-automata"><a class="header" href="#animate-spawn-automata">Animate Spawn: Automata</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;Five is alive.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Not all attempts to create life are truly successful. Without the spark of individuality, an animate machine is simply a machine that moves, not necessarily a machine that thinks or <em>feels</em>. Depending upon its original purpose and the skill of construction, a non-luminary Animate is not that different from a zombie. They generally have human-like attributes with Patience of the Mountains, Nimble Feet, and Vigor, but are often constructed with integral armor and/or weapons consummate with their superior Strength.</p>
<p>Clones and homunculi without the spark of a Luminary are <em>literally</em> just a Shambler or a Soulless but without Abyss of the Body.</p>
<h3 id="witch-spawn-cultists"><a class="header" href="#witch-spawn-cultists">Witch Spawn: Cultists</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;Uhluhtc! Uhluhtc!&quot;</em></p>
<p>Magic doesn't work out very well for most people. Those who don't have the force of destiny and personality that comes with being a main character are frequently consumed by the power they attempt to wield. Becoming a cultist requires delving into the dark secrets and learning some magic. Maybe the Extra read a magic tome, maybe they got training from an actual sorcerer. Whatever the origin, they now have a basic power from Authority, Discernment, or any appropriate Astral, Infernal, or Orphic discipline, and they start going completely insane. They are the proud recipient of Master Passion Greed, and they suffer the gradually increasing penalty to resisting its lure that afflicts spawn in general. Cultists do not inherently know how to get Magic Points which depending upon what magic they learn, may not even matter, but they have the same power schedule as the corresponding Witch type for the power source.</p>
<h3 id="leviathan-spawn-mutants"><a class="header" href="#leviathan-spawn-mutants">Leviathan Spawn: Mutants</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;It's breakfast time!&quot;</em></p>
<p>The taint of Tiamat is a curse more than a blessing to most who are affected at all. While luminaries turn into badasses like Robert Olmstead, Extras with the blood appear to be normal humans <em>if they are lucky</em>. The less lucky ones become degenerate mutants who look all gross and want to eat people. They have both Patience of the Mountains and Supernatural Senses. Unlike the paranoid true Leviathan, most Mutants end up with Master Passion Hunger or Master Passion Rage. This is also what happens to extras who eat the flesh of Leviathans. They become Leviathan spawn, gradually mutating into hideous monstrosities, and they are driven to eat people (especially other Leviathans). Some Leviathan communities keep these mutant throwbacks alive in locked up basements or attics.</p>
<h3 id="transhuman-spawn-the-lost-and-the-damned"><a class="header" href="#transhuman-spawn-the-lost-and-the-damned">Transhuman Spawn: The Lost and the Damned</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;I don't believe in fate or destiny. I believe in various degrees of hatred, paranoia, and abandonment.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Transhuman Spawn in many cases are not <em>exactly</em> the same thing as regular Transhumans who are extras (and therefore doomed). But the concept is similar. A human Extra who is lost in the Dreamlands when their body dies becomes a Jalus. They live out the rest of their lives in Maya, surviving day to day in that ghastly jungle mostly by dint of no one noticing them, which generally only works because they have Hide From Notice. A human Extra who is adopted by spirits that aren't their own can be turned into a Medium. This is basically like being a Reborn Spawn, and while they get Summon Spirit, they <em>mostly</em> get to be picked on by ghosts and go crazy. However, breaking the pattern, a human Extra who is imprisoned for an extended period in the Dark Reflection or who draws upon the power of an Infernal artifact gradually becomes a Fallen Spawn. They gain access to Light of Ennui and make up the majority of the human inhabitants of Limbo. In all cases, Transhuman Spawn are afflicted with Master Passion Despair, and for all the good it does them, they have the same power schedules as their associated Transhuman type.</p>
<h3 id="outlier-spawn-true-rejects"><a class="header" href="#outlier-spawn-true-rejects">Outlier Spawn: True Rejects</a></h3>
<p><em>TK</em></p>
<p>Outlier spawn tend to be other things entirely. Dryad spawn are just normal humans subject to Mind Root; other than being emotionless husks there isn't much else to note about them. Revenant spawn are regular Shamblers or Soulless.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="master-passions-losing-control"><a class="header" href="#master-passions-losing-control">Master Passions: Losing Control</a></h2>
<p><em>&quot;Rar!&quot;</em></p>
<p>Characters in the realm of horror are often the carriers of some pretty hefty psychological baggage. Burdened by curses and sustained by dark magic, most supernaturals have a pretty tenuous grip on their sanity and even their composure. The beast lurks rather shallowly beneath the surface, and when a supernatural creature transforms into their War Form, it does not even do that. </p>
<p>When subject to strong stimuli, a supernatural character may completely fly off the handle and start doing crazy crap. Players are encouraged to roleplay their loss of control to the hilt. While often as not being fairly useless or even detrimental to their own life goals, the erratic and extreme actions of such a character are quite a spotlight hog. Such rampages can make or break a story, and Frenzy tests should be made sparingly.</p>
<p>To control Frenzy a character makes a Willpower test plus an appropriate skill. What skills can be used to add to that test vary depending upon the Passion. For example, a character subject to Fear Frenzy may attempt to control it with a Willpower + Combat, a Willpower + Tactics, or a Willpower + Sabotage test. When a character has already entered frenzy they will <em>eventually</em> calm down. The trigger for potentially calming down is usually related to the trigger that set them off in the first place (for example, a character in hunger frenzy would have a chance to come out of it when they sated the hunger, though of course if they failed to end it at that point they'd just continue to fruitlessly feed), but a character can attempt to end a frenzy at any time by spending an Edge. The test to end a frenzy uses the same dicepool as the test to prevent one in the first place. The threshold to keep one's self from flipping out is based on the severity of the stimulus, and the threshold to end it once it has begun is the same. All frenzies <em>eventually</em> end, and if a character is provided multiple opportunities to end a frenzy each subsequent attempt is made against a threshold one lower. Characters with a higher Potency are more emotionally unstable and less human, and their thresholds for avoiding/ending a frenzy are increased by half their Potency (rounded down).</p>
<p>Staying around people is emotionally destabilizing for supernatural creatures. There are a lot of stimuli to deal with and there are a lot of disappointments and frustrations. Every month that a supernatural creature attempts to live within mortal society, they should make a frenzy test. The threshold for the first month is 1, but it increases by 1 each additional month. A supernatural character who stays long in society <em>will</em> hulk out eventually. The only ways around this are to run off and meditate or periodically freak out under hopefully controlled circumstances.</p>
<p>Each supernatural type has a most common Master Passion (Despair for Transhumans, Fear for Leviathans, Greed for Witches, Hunger for Vampires, Loneliness for Animates, and Rage for Lycanthropes). But individual characters are by definition individuals, and may choose any Master Passion as befits their character's story and idiom. Some non-playable types can have multiple Master Passions or none at all. Others have special rules governing their use of passions. The Soulless are in a constant state of rage frenzy that never ends; Akuma are subject to frenzies of rage, hunger, <em>and</em> fear; while the Pods have no passions at all (Master or otherwise).</p>
<p>Frenzy is not completely useless. Whilst in Frenzy, a character's Strength and Willpower are increased by 1. Although they are usually not of much use socially even so.</p>

<h4 id="a-note-on-mental-illness"><a class="header" href="#a-note-on-mental-illness">A Note on Mental Illness</a></h4>
<p>This is an important and ultimately simple point that many people (but not, we trust, you, dear reader) will nonetheless misunderstand: After Sundown is not making the statement that mental illness makes you a monster. If anything, it's the other way around. Master Passions and Distinctive Flaws are supernatural afflictions that represent the downside of being a monster and are sometimes mistaken for mental illnesses, but are not meant to represent them.</p>

<h3 id="master-passion-despair"><a class="header" href="#master-passion-despair">Master Passion Despair</a></h3>
<p><em>Shinj [ʃɪndʒ]<br />
-Verb (used without object)
to absolutely flip out in existential uncertainty and despair to the point of being unable to accomplish life goals.</em></p>
<p>A character with a Master Passion of Despair is prone to fits of despondency that render them unpredictable, both destructive and self-destructive. Characters subject to despair frenzy may withdraw for long periods and show signs that a mortal would diagnose as clinical depression. But while actually in a despair frenzy the character's actions are often terrifying to behold. Alternately comatose and prone to massive destruction, a despairing character withdraws from or pushes away the entire world. Their work may be destroyed, as might anything nearby. A despairing rampage is born out of a combination of fear and frustration, and usually tends more to the &quot;simplicity&quot; of mass destruction.</p>
<p>Characters dominated by Master Passion Despair are affected the rest of the time in one of two main ways. Some characters seem to &quot;make up&quot; for their black moods by being relentlessly upbeat the rest of the time. The precipice that such a character falls off as the pendulum swings from their ability to maintain cheerfulness and completely giving up to bitterness and regret is frightening to behold. Other characters run the razor's edge of melancholy all the time. These characters wander through life wearing black eyeliner and noting all glasses as being at least half empty and possibly contaminated by spider eggs. It is important to note that whether the character is characterized better as Eeyore or Stimpy in their normal interactions with the world, that the actual frustrations required to push the character into madness are the same. The manic characters may <em>seem</em> happier on a moment to moment basis, but that joy is fragile - as close to the void as the permanently depressed. </p>
<p>Triggers for a despair frenzy usually take the form of setbacks of some form or another. Triggers to end a despair frenzy are either things that would cheer them up, or the galvanizing action of seeing something that mattered to them destroyed during their frenzy (often as not <em>by</em> their frenzy). Key skills are Survival, Persuasion, and Operations. Master Passion Despair is the usual drive of Transhumans.</p>
<h3 id="master-passion-fear"><a class="header" href="#master-passion-fear">Master Passion Fear</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;All motivations are merely a subset of fear. A fear of irrelevance.&quot;</em></p>
<p>A character with Master Passion Fear lives in absolute terror every day of their existence. Harried constantly by the need for a feeling of security that eludes them eternally, they find firsthand that Fear is a cruel and unforgiving mistress. Not a few mastered by fear dig themselves into a figurative (or even literal) hole and become virtually paralyzed with binding paranoia and a crushing fear of the unknown that limits their movements and holds them fast within some real or imaginary fortress, but this is by no means universal. Fear can be a motivator that is easily mistaken for positive, because while it can easily prevent someone from doing needful things, it can also force the fearful hand into action. When <em>not</em> acting is more feared even than venturing into the unknown, the terrorized act with hurried finality. It is important to note that virtually all player characters are going to subscribe to the panicked urgency school of crippling disquietude rather than the torporous catatonia school of life-ruining trepidation.</p>
<p>Those laboring under Master Passion Fear are prone to Frenzy and Despondency, but always one more than the other. Each person's nightmares drive them to different irrational extremes. Triggers to enter a Fear Frenzy include both what Lemony Snicket would call the &quot;rational fears&quot; (such as being threatened or wounded) and the &quot;irrational fears&quot; (which are deeply personal jitters that are difficult, even embarrassing, to explain to others). Each fearful character should pick some of the latter, things which quicken the pulse and dominate their nightmares. Triggers to hopefully end despondency come when and where the character can find comfort, whether this is a warm bed, a dark hiding place, or the arms of a compatriot. Key skills are Combat, Tactics, and Sabotage. Master Passion Fear is the most common motivation of Leviathans, which in some way accounts for how many of them leave society of all types and simply hide in the wilderness.</p>
<h3 id="master-passion-greed"><a class="header" href="#master-passion-greed">Master Passion Greed</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;I feed the mouth that bites me.&quot;</em></p>
<p>A character with Master Passion Greed is dominated by a need to have things. Not <em>necessarily</em> &quot;valuable&quot; things according to disinterested onlookers, and <em>certainly</em> not all things that have value - even to themselves. Greed is at its heart the irrational feeling of the need to acquire, since we don't even <em>notice</em> it (much less condemn it with such a judgmental word as Greed) when people act upon their desires to acquire things that are necessary for their survival or lifestyle. And those characters who are mastered by their greed become fixated on acquiring specific things. At any given time, a character driven by Greed will have something that they &quot;must-have&quot; and will take special effort to get it on a regular basis. Actual frenzies may occur when a character gets &quot;very close&quot; to their current goal and suffers a setback. Greed is a fickle mistress, and once a character achieves their goal, it will fall to them to find a new goal and pursue that (although in some cases this may be as simple as &quot;get a lot of money&quot; followed by &quot;get even more money&quot;).</p>
<p>Master Passion Greed can deeply affect a character's life even when they are not in frenzy. The rotating obsessions can lead to a destructive cycle of accumulation and spending. Once the character gains the money they were after, they may well spend it all on boats and other frivolities and then go back to hunting for money.</p>
<p>Of all the master passions, Master Passion Greed works best in children's literature, and you can find a tremendous number of examples of its placement in stories and cartoons for that reason. Players may be tempted to channel Gromgold or Gargemel, and this is not unreasonable. But it's not just antagonist wizards that are like this in stories. Many anime characters such as Lina Inverse can give a good template for the cycle of desire.</p>
<p>Actual frenzies from Master Passion Greed usually involve a destructiveness brought out by sheer frustration. Having gotten so close to their goal only to be thwarted, the character hurls themselves in a last-ditch (often obviously futile) attempt to grab on to their desire. Things in the way are blasted with everything at their disposal and clear dangers and social conventions are completely ignored. Think the end of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Key skills are Stealth, Empathy, and Rigging. Master Passion Greed is the most common motivation of Witches.</p>
<h3 id="master-passion-hunger"><a class="header" href="#master-passion-hunger">Master Passion Hunger</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;I want to suck your blood.&quot;</em></p>
<p>A character with Master Passion Hunger is prone to harsh and painful pangs of emptiness, which slowly eat away at their sense of self when their power reserves are low. These fires of hunger can burn out of control and turn them into desperate, destructive beasts unless or until quenched by sapient flesh, blood, or pain. While this is obviously most commonly an affliction of those who get their power from an actual Feeding schedule or who otherwise prey on sapients, even those who don't rely on power for it can potentially have this passion. It is dangerous in such characters because unless the character's power schedule is Feeding they will remain low in power reserves (and thus potentially subject to more frenzy) even after chewing on a dude.</p>
<p>The hunger manifests continually in a manner that is just barely noticeable, and the unnerving awareness of the flesh and blood of those around them can easily be mistaken for simple sexual arousal. While actually in a hunger frenzy, the character's actions are more terrifying than simply unnerving. Moving with wild abandon, a hungering character dives upon others to consume what their pangs drive them to. A hunger rampage is born out of desires both to sate themselves and to cause great pain, and often results in a bloody rending of the victim's flesh.</p>
<p>Triggers for a hunger frenzy usually take the form of depleted Power. Triggers to end a hunger frenzy are either something which makes them lethargic (including simply being full of other foods), or having drained a victim dry. Key skills are Stealth, Animal Ken, and Medicine. Master Passion Hunger is the usual drive of Vampires.</p>
<h3 id="master-passion-loneliness"><a class="header" href="#master-passion-loneliness">Master Passion Loneliness</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;We were meant to be together. If I wasn't made for you, why do I exist?!&quot;</em></p>
<p>A character with Master Passion Loneliness is prone to excruciating, almost, <em>paralyzing</em>, pain. The pain of feeling incomplete, cut off, and alone. These feelings come rapidly when they are alone, and even creep up when they are surrounded by other people. Alienation is exacerbated by Master Passion Loneliness to the point of clear instability. They end up doing things to draw attention to themselves out of desperation, stunts that often as not actively push others away. Many with Master Passion Loneliness feel that what is missing from their life is a lover, but friendship or even just <em>acknowledgment</em> is a frequently cited lack as well.</p>
<p>A Loneliness Frenzy usually takes the form of a series of drastic and poorly conceived cries for help and attention. These can be incredibly destructive to things around them and even themselves. Petulant and half-hearted attempts on their own life are not uncommon. While the goal is always to focus the attention of the character and/or to punish others for abandoning them, the logical connection between their rampage and encouraging people to socialize with them can be... hard to explain. Loneliness Frenzies can be triggered by any abandonment, real or imagined. Characters with Master Passion Loneliness are prone to the worst sorts of jealousy on the smallest of provocations, and behave clingy and desperate even when relationships are seemingly normal. Key skills are Larceny, Intimidate, and Artisan. Master Passion Loneliness is the usual state of being for Animates.</p>
<h3 id="master-passion-rage"><a class="header" href="#master-passion-rage">Master Passion Rage</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;You're making me angry. You wouldn't like me when I'm angry.&quot;</em></p>
<p>A character with Master Passion Rage is short-tempered, and when their temper goes off they completely lose it: attacking their enemies, destroying the scenery, attacking bystanders, and destroying their relationships. Characters subject to rage frenzy will often lash out at others for perceived slights, both verbally and physically, but it is not until they are pushed into frenzy that their true and terrifying potential is unleashed. A raging character uses every power at their disposal to smash everything and everyone they perceive as vexing or hostile. Failing that, they will turn on inanimate objects and even innocent and irrelevant people as their inability to get their hands (or teeth, or balls of fire, or whatever) on something they can readily identify as a threat or a sleight becomes itself a source of anger. A raging rampage is born out of sheer anger, and seeks to remove the source of their anger through the simplest of emotionally-triggered reactions - pure violence.</p>
<p>Characters with Master Passion Rage are incredibly confrontational. Their &quot;fight or flight&quot; reflex pretty much always defaults to &quot;fight&quot; even in the face of extreme danger. They also don't like losing, being thwarted in even small ways, or being ignored. In supernatural society it is taken as a truism that you shouldn't let lycanthropes drive or play cards if you can arrange to avoid it.</p>
<p>Triggers for a rage frenzy usually take the form of a threat to the character's person or pride. Anything that would make a human fly into a rage works too. While threats to a person are usually pretty self-explanatory (injuries or threats of violence), injuries to the pride are legitimately different for different people. Players are encouraged to have some &quot;sensitive subjects&quot; that piss them off beyond reason. And we <em>do</em> mean beyond reason. Triggers to end a rage frenzy are either things that would calm them, or the galvanizing action of seeing someone they care about hurt at their own hands (often after the wounds are lethal). Key skills are Athletics, Bureaucracy, and Research.. Master Passion Rage is the usual drive of Lycanthropes.</p>
<h3 id="emptiness"><a class="header" href="#emptiness">Emptiness</a></h3>
<p><em>TK</em></p>
<p>Emptiness is in some ways the opposite of a Master Passion: a total absence of emotion. While it might seem relatively tolerable compared to a Master Passion, humans are actually generally incapable of handling Emptiness and those afflicted with it are effectively in a Despondency all the time and not likely to survive long, being indifferent to stimuli such as pain or hunger.</p>
<p>Those subject to Emptiness are immune to all forms of emotional appeal. They tend not to have attachments to Ethical Taboos or even Ideologies. Most beings subject to Emptiness would seem to be Aimless (as per the Disadvantage), but some have an isolated motivation subject to no distraction or temptation - as characterizes Thrillers - and can recover Edge just fine. Emptiness is suitable only for unplayable supernatural types such as Evil Plants, Mockeries, Thrillers, and Automata, for whom it can replace the need for a Master Passion.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="magic"><a class="header" href="#magic">Magic</a></h1>
<h2 id="the-limits-of-magic"><a class="header" href="#the-limits-of-magic">The Limits of Magic</a></h2>
<p><em>&quot;She made me into a newt!&quot;</em></p>
<p>Magic in a told story does not need to have <em>explicit</em> limits defined for it because it has <em>implicit</em> limits of whatever it is that magic happens to do in the story. One can assume that many of the things that magic never did in the narrative were actually outside its capabilities for one reason or another and that it all worked out somehow. A novel or a movie does not have to tell you that an evil magic car <em>can't</em> turn into a giant robot, the fact that it <em>doesn't</em> is sufficient for the medium; however, in a <em>role playing game</em> this is not the case. Since magic is going to be used in creative, goal-oriented ways by multiple story contributors (which is a nice way of saying &quot;people are going to push magic as far as it will go into unintended directions to gain personal advantage&quot;), it is imperative that what magic is specifically capable (and by extension <em>not</em> capable) of doing be codified.</p>
<p>Magic in After Sundown comes in several flavors. Most importantly, magic falls into one of three categories based on where its power comes from. All magic is connected to the Otherworlds, and the particular world flavors everything about it. These are Astral, Infernal, and Orphic. Supernatural creatures are also inherently tied to these same power sources. Some basic abilities are &quot;Universal&quot;, but they still have a power source based on that of the character using them.</p>
<p>Every supernatural type has some inherent magic associated with it. It's generally not a good idea to vary these, but as in all things you can if you want to. Having these shared powers is part of what defines a monstrous type and how they fit into the larger setting and monstrous society. The extra choice of Basic and Advanced powers that character gain following their transformation already give a lot of leeway for customization and the Witch types can be used to build heavily customized monsters.</p>
<h2 id="using-powers"><a class="header" href="#using-powers">Using Powers</a></h2>
<p>Every character that has a power is assumed to have some basic knowledge about how it works and at least a vague understanding of the other powers in the same Discipline. For this reason, characters never have to default and take a penalty because they don't have the Skills for the dicepools that can be rolled with a power; they can always just roll one of the listed Attributes. On the other hand, because magic is fundamentally unlike normal applications of a skill they don't get the benefits of a Specialization either.</p>
<h2 id="dowsing-detecting-magic"><a class="header" href="#dowsing-detecting-magic">Dowsing: Detecting Magic</a></h2>
<p><em>&quot;No way. No way nohow.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Sorcery and witchcraft don't &quot;just happen&quot;; it requires a great deal of evil knowledge and a fair amount of effort. And indeed that exertion can be detected and the efforts unraveled. Those in the know can detect and track the use of spells and sorcery by their effects on certain elements of the world.</p>
<p>Magic has definite effects on the physical world, and can be detected through careful observation of its effects. The particulars of detection are specific to whether it is Astral, Infernal, or Orphic. And when creatures who are personally one of those types use Universal Powers they can be detected as if they were using magic of that type. So if a Frankenstein (an Orphic creature) uses Devastation to lift a car it is an Orphic Magical Action and can be detected by the browning of nearby leaves; while an Android (an Infernal creature) doing the same thing would be an Infernal Magical Action that could be detected by the clouding of clear water.</p>
<p>When a creature activates a power, characters with the right equipment and know-how can spot the power surge with a Dowsing Test. A Dowsing Test can always be Intuition + Perception, but dowsing for Astral Magic can also be Logic + Electronics, dowsing for Infernal Magic can also be Logic + Survival, and dowsing for Orphic Magic can also be Charisma + Animal Ken. In general, the threshold to notice magic at normal range is 2, and the threshold to give a good directionality to where the magic was used is 4. Mostly, Basic Powers are detectable to Way Out Range, Advanced Powers or the expenditure of 3 or more Magic Points are detectable to Extreme Range, and Elder Powers or the expenditure of 5 Magic Points are detectable out to Remote Range. The expenditure of more than 5 Magic Points at once is detectable out to as many kilometers.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clean Water:</strong> Clean water is pure and healthy and brings joy and solace. It is very much inimical to the magic of the Dark Reflection, which causes clear water to become darkened momentarily as if it was tainted with soot. An experienced douser can track the strength and direction of the use of Infernal sorcery by the darkness, apparent direction, and persistence of the image of taint in otherwise clear water.</li>
<li><strong>Flowers:</strong> Orphic Sorcery is bad for you. Like polonium or something. But for big creatures it's not something you'd notice without years of exposure, leaving the observable effects to the very most fragile of lifeforms - those who would soon die in any case. And while one <em>could</em> tote around a bag full of mayflies or the like, most people in the know who want to track necromancers choose to use potted plants. A flower that blooms and dies every day is of course ideal, as it has high responsiveness and gives good directionality.</li>
<li><strong>Magnets:</strong> Astral Sorcery has a noticeable, if weird, affect on magnetic fields. You can track Astral Sorcery and gauge its power with a lodestone. Natural magnetite reacts more strongly than an electro-magnet for whatever reason, so experienced geomancers seriously carry a black rock on a string when they want to find dream sorcerers, but you can use an ordinary compass in a pinch.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="countering-and-dispelling-magic"><a class="header" href="#countering-and-dispelling-magic">Countering and Dispelling Magic</a></h2>
<p>In addition to being able to <em>detect</em> magic by its physical effects, you can sometimes also <em>counter</em> magic with the right physical material.</p>
<p>Throwing a handful of whatever appropriate powder at a source of magic is a Simple Action, and involves making an Intuition + Rigging or Agility + Athletics test (or Agility + Combat if using a appropriately rigged weapon, such as a shotgun loaded with salt shells), reducing the effective hits of the original casting by the hits gained. Once used to counter magic, the powder is completely spoiled. You can't sweep it up and use it again. While this is technically sorcery itself, it can be taught to any Luminary or supernatural creature in moments - you literally just reach into the bag, throw a handful of the stuff at the magic with intent to nullify, and it generally works pretty well. A power that is dispelled completely is suppressed and cannot be reactivated for the rest of the scene. The particular substance required depends on the power source of the magic to be affected, and using the wrong powder doesn't do anything but make a mess.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Salt:</strong> Salt draws water into itself and preserves food. Things treated with salt remain clean and non-poisonous long after untreated objects blacken and stink with putrescence. Thrown at Astral magic it draws the wetness and poison of the sorcery into itself and dampens it.</li>
<li><strong>Sand:</strong> The fires of Limbo burn ceaselessly, but they <em>are</em> still fires. Clean sand thrown upon them douses them - cutting off the source of wicked Infernal sorcery.</li>
<li><strong>Seeds:</strong> Representing the promise of new life and the growth of great strength from humble origins, the seed is a key ritual component in practically every mortal magical tradition ever devised. And indeed, throwing it on Orphic magic results in the nullification of both.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="disciplines"><a class="header" href="#disciplines">Disciplines</a></h2>
<p>Magical powers are grouped into interrelated paths of development called Disciplines. Disciplines are fairly broad and often represent many different paths to power that are grouped game mechanically because that's playable. Nevertheless, to represent the different approaches that magic responds to, every power with a dicepool to activate presents two different dice pools that they can be activated with.</p>
<p>Disciplines are divided by power source. Universal Disciplines tend to be broader and more subtle powers that are common to many types of supernatural creatures, while Disciplines aspected to particular Otherworlds represent magical knowledge that develop around that world's particular themes. The distinction is not always obvious, but Astral, Infernal, and Orphic Disciplines can be learned, taught, and found in books, while Universal powers tend to be things that &quot;just happen&quot;.</p>
<h3 id="power-levels"><a class="header" href="#power-levels">Power Levels</a></h3>
<p>There are three levels of achievement within each Discipline: <strong>Basic</strong>, <strong>Advanced</strong>, and <strong>Elder</strong>. A character must have at least one Basic ability in a Discipline before they can learn an Advanced ability of that Discipline, and a character must have at least one Advanced ability in a Discipline before they can learn an Elder ability of that Discipline. Further, each tier carries a minimum Potency requirement (1 for Basic, 2 for Advanced, and 3 or more for Elder). Abilities within a Discipline are otherwise unordered. A character can learn any Basic ability and then learn another Basic ability or skip to learning an Advanced ability.  Characters built for In Media Res games begin play with only Basic and Advanced abilities.</p>
<p>Elder powers tend to be more individualized to the possessor. Some may be fairly simple ways of intensifying or transcending the limitations of existing Basic and Advanced abilities, while others may be short-cuts to performing tricks otherwise limited to Mighty Rituals of Vast Power. Suggested Elder abilities and guidelines for their creation are described separately in Chapter TK, along with descriptions of the Elder powers that are standard to non-player supernatural types. Power Fantasy characters begin with a single, signature Elder power that they should develop with the MC for their game.</p>
<h2 id="power-tags"><a class="header" href="#power-tags">Power Tags</a></h2>
<p>Magic in After Sundown comes in several flavors beyond the division into Universal, Astral, Infernal, and Orphic. In the interest of standardization and clarity, common variations are marked with tags in the power's description.</p>
<p>Sometimes particular types of monsters (or just individuals) have their peculiar variations on a power, which are marked by giving the power an additional after its name; for instance, a Troll has Giant Size <em>Mutation</em>, meaning they cannot control their Giant Size as if it were a Protean power and are stuck with it always on. Tags added to particular types or individuals override tags listed on the base power when declared this way.</p>
<h3 id="list-of-power-tags"><a class="header" href="#list-of-power-tags">List of Power Tags</a></h3>
<h4 id="blatant"><a class="header" href="#blatant">Blatant</a></h4>
<p>Blatant powers are obvious to everyone viewing them; they do something impossible and supernatural. Breath of the Dragon just can't be easily passed off as tricks and coincidence. Using Blatant powers in front of mortal witnesses is always a breach of the Vow of Silence unless decisively covered up. A power that is neither Blatant nor Subtle may or may not be considered a violation depending on the circumstances.</p>
<h4 id="enchantment"><a class="header" href="#enchantment">Enchantment</a></h4>
<p>While the magic of some powers is over in an instant - no matter how long-lasting the side effects - other powers create a lasting Enchantment that may still be dispelled with salt, sand, or seeds depending on the power source that produced it, such as returning a victim of Humbled Form to their natural shape. If no roll is used to produce the effect consider the default threshold to dispel the Enchantment to be 4 unless otherwise specified.</p>
<h4 id="passive"><a class="header" href="#passive">Passive</a></h4>
<p>With a Passive power the character doesn't need to do anything to activate it, they just always have the benefit (and perhaps detriment) of having it. Fire Walker keeps protecting a Deava no matter what they do. Many Passive powers add bonuses to mundane actions, while others modify or remove limitations to other powers. Passive powers usually do not have a cost or action associated with their description. Passive powers still function even when the character is subject to their supernatural weakness and cannot be dispelled.</p>
<h4 id="protean"><a class="header" href="#protean">Protean</a></h4>
<p>Some powers are Protean abilities that allow shape-shifting and general changes to the character's body, such as Beast Form letting them turn into a particular kind of animal. A character who knows any Protean power can return to their real form with a Complex action and a Magic Point even if they have been transformed by hostile magic. Furthermore, if a character has multiple Protean abilities they may activate more than one simultaneously, and the entire transformation takes the action of the longest transformation; e.g. a character could both become fearsome with War Form and grow extra limbs with Eightfold Grasp with a single Complex action.</p>
<h4 id="mutation"><a class="header" href="#mutation">Mutation</a></h4>
<p>A Mutation is an alternative way to have a power that is normally activated temporarily, usually an Enchantment and/or Protean. Instead of having the ability to turn the power on and off or to shapeshift between forms the character is stuck with the power &quot;always-on&quot;, and can't turn it off or shift back into their &quot;normal&quot; form. In effect, the power becomes Passive and represents their normal form. For instance, an Android character with Flesh of Marble could be made of metal. While this can be inconvenient, it frees them from having to pay any Magic Point or action cost to activate the ability. A character that has a Mutation doesn't get the normal generic Protean ability to shift back to their &quot;real&quot; form unless they have another normal Protean power. An entry for a monstrous type or particular character should note which powers are taken as Mutations.</p>
<h4 id="native"><a class="header" href="#native">Native</a></h4>
<p>Native powers, while nominally part of an Otherworldly discipline, act like Universal powers to the extent that their power source is considered to be that of the creature that has them. For example, although Bite of the Serpent is usually an Orphic power, the kiss of a Dryad is considered Astral magic all the same as it is considered a core expression of their supernatural nature. This tag is not used to mark power descriptions (because it would be better to just <em>make</em> that power into a Universal power), but applied to the starting powers of certain types of monsters (or occasionally particular characters) where it doesn't make a lot of sense for their defining abilities to be a different kind of magic than they are.</p>
<h4 id="sorcery"><a class="header" href="#sorcery">Sorcery</a></h4>
<p>Sorcery requires the user to do something distinctly magical to use the power, although the distinction between Sorcery and a Talent can be quite subtle. The best example is probably the difference between Command and Mesmerism: Command just seems like using an authoritative voice, while Mesmerism is clearly unusual behavior, although easily passed off as stage magic rather than the real thing. Thematically speaking, sorcery is magical knowledge that most characters must learn from cultic tutors or books of magic. The most important mechanical difference is that powers marked as Sorcery can be dispelled with the standard salt/sand/seeds routine as they are being used.</p>
<h4 id="talent"><a class="header" href="#talent">Talent</a></h4>
<p>As opposed to Sorcery, some powers are natural outgrowths of supernatural ability; they are intuitively or instinctively understood by the user and generally don't require any particularly mystical behavior to accomplish. Their effects may be blatantly supernatural, but from the user's perspective they just happen; e.g. a Strigoi using Vigor doesn't make a magical incantation or gesture but just focuses on being stronger and their magical power makes it happen.</p>
<h4 id="subtle"><a class="header" href="#subtle">Subtle</a></h4>
<p>Subtle powers are not easily noticed and using them does not produce any obvious evidence or indication of their activation, although sometimes their consequences may still be noticeable or even considered to be breaks of the Vow of Silence under very unusual circumstances when the character is under very sharp and suspicious observation. Subtle powers still cause a glow around the user and target when they are viewed with Aura Perception.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="universal-disciplines"><a class="header" href="#universal-disciplines">Universal Disciplines</a></h1>
<p><em>&quot;This is what we are, and this is what you are.&quot;</em></p>
<p>There are many things that magic can do in horror, and one of the most salient things for After Sundown is that it allows supernatural creatures to do amazing things. Universal powers are those that owe no special allegiance to any world or cult. They usually require no magic words or special gestures. Most importantly they can be spontaneously developed. A character who has the requisite option at character creation or advancement can simply acquire a Universal Power without any access to special training or magical research books.</p>
<h2 id="authority"><a class="header" href="#authority">Authority</a></h2>
<p><em>&quot;Look me in the eyes and tell me that again.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Authority is the power to impress one's Will directly upon another. Authority requires eye contact to function, although only cursorily. A character who is closing their eyes or wearing mirrorshades cannot be controlled with Authority (unless the user has Will to Power). A character who is actively attempting to avoid seeing a potential dominator's eyes may be able to do so, depending upon the actions in question. Activating Authority is generally an opposed test with the target defending with Willpower. When a character is compelled to do something which is against their Ideology, Taboos, or Passions (usually including following suicidal orders, since staying alive is at least instrumental to most other goals), they may spend an action dithering. They at this point lose an entire round of actions as they have their internal struggle, making an additional resistance check to attempt to shake off the effects. If they again fail to resist the effects, they carry out the order even if it is something they are deeply opposed to. Most effects of Authority are not Enchantments, and once they take hold they cannot be dispelled, although they may be removed with Purify the Mind.</p>
<p>Most uses of Authority require instructions to be given to the victim in a manner that they can comprehend. Usually, this requires verbal orders to be given in a language they understand, but sign language, written directions, and even silent telepathic commands can suffice.</p>
<h3 id="basic-authority"><a class="header" href="#basic-authority">Basic Authority</a></h3>
<h4 id="command"><a class="header" href="#command">Command</a></h4>
<p><em>Talent</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> -</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Simple, Willpower + Intimidation or Logic + Tactics vs. Willpower</p>
<p>The character gives an instantaneous verbal command, which the victim will follow to the best of their ability. The action itself must be essentially instantaneous, using up no more than a single complex action, and it needs to be able to be expressed in about 12 seconds. If it is of an open-ended nature such as &quot;lie down,&quot; then the victim will spend one complex action doing it, and then they are free to do as they please and wonder why they did that. Commands such as &quot;sleep&quot; or &quot;die&quot; cause the victim to faint, but they may be awakened normally after one round.</p>
<h4 id="mesmerism"><a class="header" href="#mesmerism">Mesmerism</a></h4>
<p><em>Sorcery, Subtle</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> -</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Extended (1+ minute), Logic + Expression or Willpower + Intimidation vs. Willpower</p>
<p>The character can hypnotize a victim, allowing them to give extended commands that will be obeyed. The expected time to bring someone under Mesmerism so that instructions can begin is one minute, then commands must be stressed and repeated, with each major instruction taking approximately an additional minute to convey. During the period of hypnotism, the victim stands there like a hypnotized drone, but behaves seemingly normally when they go off to carry out their instructions. Any sudden sensory stimulation (such as a nearby gunshot or someone shaking the victim) during the Mesmerism breaks the spell.</p>
<h4 id="suggestion"><a class="header" href="#suggestion">Suggestion</a></h4>
<p><em>Talent, Subtle</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> -</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Simple, Logic + Persuasion or Willpower + Expression vs. Willpower</p>
<p>The character can offer a suggestion that the victim will then immediately themselves suggest as if it were their own idea. Whether this idea is followed up upon or discarded as &quot;a bad idea&quot; depends entirely upon how they feel about the idea once they've said it to themselves. The immediate victim does not remember being fed the suggestion in the first place, but the scene may look odd to onlookers.</p>
<h3 id="advanced-authority"><a class="header" href="#advanced-authority">Advanced Authority</a></h3>
<h4 id="cloud-memory"><a class="header" href="#cloud-memory">Cloud Memory</a></h4>
<p><em>Sorcery</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> -</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Extended (1+ minute), Logic + Artisan or Willpower + Expression vs. Willpower</p>
<p>Cloud Memory allows the character to erase or alter the memories of a victim. A single use of Cloud Memory can alter about 5 minutes of memory, but net hits increase the time frame. A Luminary who is presented with proof that their memories are incorrect may spend a Fate point to remember. Extras just have to resolve those discrepancies somehow.</p>
<h4 id="enslave"><a class="header" href="#enslave">Enslave</a></h4>
<p><em>Sorcery</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> 1 Magic Point per target Potency</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Extended (1 day per target Willpower), Logic + Tactics or Willpower + Intimidation vs Willpower + Edge + Potency</p>
<p>Using extended mind control techniques, a victim's will is broken and they are transformed into a servant of the character's. Breaking someone's mind in this manner is an extended task that has an expected time frame of 1 day per point of the victim's Willpower. Raw supernatural power makes a big difference in establishing control, so the Potency of the target is added to the difficulty threshold. Once a victim has been Enslaved, they follow all orders their new master gives them as if they had been imparted with the force of a successful Mesmerism. Through the process of Enslaving the character may choose to alter the Ideologies, Taboos, and general demeanor of their victim (this is often done to make the giving of orders that would be against the original nature easier to do). Using Enslave fails if the process is interrupted long enough that it is not continued between when the sun rises or sets and the next time it sets or rises.</p>
<h4 id="purify-the-mind"><a class="header" href="#purify-the-mind">Purify the Mind</a></h4>
<p><em>Sorcery</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> 2 Magic Points</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Extended (10 minutes), Logic + Empathy or Willpower + Tactics</p>
<p>The character can heal madness in others. The purification requires continuous hand-to-face contact and eye contact. The difficulty threshold depends on how extreme the mental problem is. A mere life-damaging phobia requires professional intervention (Threshold 3), while a life-destroying insanity is crazy extreme (Threshold 5). Undoing mental damage and memory edits from magical sources, such as other Authority powers, always has a Threshold equal to the number of hits that created the effect in the first place. If the character cures the affliction or just barely fails to they know what it was and what it was about, so they can say something explanatory and insightful if they want. If the character fails by more than one hit they get nothing but some nightmarish imagery and vague clues.</p>
<h4 id="will-to-power"><a class="header" href="#will-to-power">Will to Power</a></h4>
<p><em>Passive</em></p>
<p>The character can ignore the eye contact restriction on Authority, allowing them to use the discipline on plants and ghosts and people wearing mirrorshades. The target must still be able to receive the character's commands somehow, whether by hearing or seeing their instructions or through telepathic contact.</p>
<h2 id="celerity"><a class="header" href="#celerity">Celerity</a></h2>
<p><em>There she goes again.</em></p>
<p>Celerity is the power to move with the astonishing speed of the supernatural. In general, a character whose Celerity more than doubles their speed in any dimension would constitute a breach of the Vow of Silence, although usually characters are able to hold themselves down to a speed that seems merely extraordinary rather than fully impossible if they so choose. While Celerity becomes quite expensive in terms of Magic Points, it is designed such that powers do not usually require a roll or action to activate, as those things paradoxically slow down the experience of acting quickly. Characters are specifically allowed to activate as many Celerity powers with a Free Action as they please.</p>
<h3 id="basic-celerity"><a class="header" href="#basic-celerity">Basic Celerity</a></h3>
<h4 id="nimble-feet"><a class="header" href="#nimble-feet">Nimble Feet</a></h4>
<p><em>Talent</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> 1 Magic Point per scene</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Free, automatic</p>
<p>The character can walk and run at stupendous speeds. Personal movement at all gaits rate is quadrupled for a scene, although the character may hold back their speed if they wish. Also, the character ignores penalties for acting while moving over difficult surfaces (although they may be slowed down by them as normal). Despite being called &quot;Nimble Feet&quot;, the increased movement applies to all forms of locomotion, including crawling, climbing, swimming, jumping, or flying.</p>
<h4 id="quickness"><a class="header" href="#quickness">Quickness</a></h4>
<p><em>Subtle, Talent</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> 1 Magic Point per Scene</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Free, automatic</p>
<p>Supernatural power flows directly to enhancing the character's speed and coordination. The character's effective Agility is increased by their Potency while this power is active, which may also increase their effective defense threshold. Quickness may be reflexively continued for an additional scene for a flat cost of 1 Magic Point.</p>
<h4 id="serendipity"><a class="header" href="#serendipity">Serendipity</a></h4>
<p><em>Subtle, Talent</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> -</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Free, automatic</p>
<p>Supernatural movement isn't purely about being <em>faster</em>, it's also about acting at <em>precisely</em> the right time. With this power, the character's perfect timing and coordination allows them to take advantage of tiny opportunities that would otherwise be missed. While active, the character reduces the difficulty of all Stunts in a Chase sequence by 1. Additionally, over extended periods the character can get around quite quickly, usually reducing travel time by a factor of 2, as they weave effortlessly through traffic and obstacles and have a sixth sense about when to pour on the speed. The Stunt bonus from Serendipity does not stack with that from Clinging.</p>
<h3 id="advanced-celerity"><a class="header" href="#advanced-celerity">Advanced Celerity</a></h3>
<h4 id="flight"><a class="header" href="#flight">Flight</a></h4>
<p><em>Blatant, Enchantment, Sorcery</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> 2 or 3 Magic Points per Scene</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Free, automatic</p>
<p>The character can <em>fly</em>. Like they were a superhero. For 2 Magic Points, the character can fly for the duration of a scene so long as they maintain a speed of at least a Walk. If the character wishes to be able to slow down or hover (not move at all) without falling out of the sky, they have to spend another Magic Point. Taking off or landing in cramped areas may require an Agility + Athletics stunt. A flying character moves 3 to 5 times as fast as one walking or running along the ground (multiplied by Nimble Feet as normal), and magical flying is no more tiring that ordinary locomotion. Flight can be dispelled as a sorcery with 3 hits. A character whose flight has been dispelled falls.</p>
<h4 id="shifting-sands"><a class="header" href="#shifting-sands">Shifting Sands</a></h4>
<p><em>Subtle, Talent</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> 2 Magic Points</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Reflexive, automatic</p>
<p>The character can rewind time and change their actions accordingly. The sands of time are heavy and small, and the character can only rewind a split second. As such, crucial events whose effects are not immediately obvious to the character have already escaped their grasp long before any calamity is apparent. As a reflexive action, the character can spend a Magic Point to shift their position slightly (less than a meter) if they are immediately aware of some kind of danger (such as the floor giving way or being hit with a bullet) or another disaster. The character can use this to dodge a bullet or to be hit by a bullet that was intended for someone else, but the timing is so fine that they must make this choice before the soak roll is made. If they redirect an attack to themselves, they are stuck with no net hits, regardless of whether they would have been easier or harder to strike than the intended target. This can also be used socially to prevent major faux pas, though it is useless if the character merely gradually got on the nerves of someone else. If the character gets no hits at all on a social test, they may spend a Magic Point to re-roll all the dice. If they get even one hit, then whatever mistakes were made are too far in the past when they become apparent and this power cannot be used.</p>
<h4 id="blur"><a class="header" href="#blur">Blur</a></h4>
<p><em>Talent</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> 1 Magic Point per Scene</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Reflexive, automatic</p>
<p>The character's Celerity pours not only into their raw speed but into their perceptions: their movements become a Blur to those around them as in their own view the world slows to a crawl. While active, the character may perceive and derive meaning from fast-moving objects as if moving in bullet time. They may follow a specific card in a shuffled deck, read a sign on a speeding train, or gauge the trajectories of bullets in flight. All attacks against the character are effectively dodged, increasing the threshold to hit them by 2, and they negate any bonuses opponents would gain from coordinating attacks. Finally, the character takes no penalties for making attacks while moving, driving, climbing, etc.</p>
<h4 id="flurry"><a class="header" href="#flurry">Flurry</a></h4>
<p><em>Talent</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> 1 Magic Point per Scene</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Free, automatic</p>
<p>The character's impossibly fast movements and perfect control allow them to make flashy ranged attacks like firing multiple arrows at once into different targets, spraying a machine gun and hitting only enemy targets while missing the hostages, or flinging three knives at a target like a ninja. Effectively, all the character's attacks with ranged weapons are made with all the benefits of an automatic weapon with none of the normal downsides (within the limits of plausibility; a character can still only fire a musket once, but if several are available they could easily fire all the muskets they can reach).</p>
<h2 id="clout"><a class="header" href="#clout">Clout</a></h2>
<p><em>&quot;I have the power!&quot;</em></p>
<p>Clout is the power to draw upon the great strength of the supernatural in order to perform feats of literal strength and other blatant supernatural applications of raw force. Clout is an odd case as regards the Vow of Silence because while it is accompanied by no flaming runes or crawling shadows, demonstrations of incredible strength strain credibility and perhaps worse they <em>draw comments</em> from observers.</p>
<h3 id="basic-clout"><a class="header" href="#basic-clout">Basic Clout</a></h3>
<h4 id="clinging"><a class="header" href="#clinging">Clinging</a></h4>
<p><em>Passive</em></p>
<p>The character can hold themselves onto vertical surfaces and even ceilings for extended periods without special equipment or apparent effort. They can easily move up or down sheer surfaces at the rate of a steady walk, and scuttle across ceilings at the rate of a careful walk without danger or exertion. When such a character attempts to pull Wuxia or Spider-Man inspired stunts involving running on walls or brachiating over a crowd they find this much easier, because they can support their weight merely by putting a hand against a wall. For practical purposes, this means that such stunts are much less extreme <em>for them</em> than they appear to outsiders. The thresholds are generally reduced by 2 (a crazy extreme stunt would be merely a professional stunt from their perspective).</p>
<h4 id="smash"><a class="header" href="#smash">Smash</a></h4>
<p><em>Talent</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> 1+ Magic Points</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Reflexive, automatic</p>
<p>When the character gets angry and wants to smash something they can deliver some powerful destruction. Smash can be reflexively activated after hitting with a melee attack to add additional damage up to the character's Potency at one <em>hit</em> per Magic Point spent.</p>
<h4 id="vigor"><a class="header" href="#vigor">Vigor</a></h4>
<p><em>Subtle, Talent</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> 1 Magic Point per Scene</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Free, automatic</p>
<p>Sometimes the best use of supernatural power is raw physical power. While active the character's effective Strength is increased by their Potency, which also increases their Soak pool. While using Vigor itself has no visible effects, the <em>use</em> of vastly increased strength may be obviously unnatural to onlookers. Vigor can be reflexively continued into another scene for a flat cost of 1 Magic Point.</p>
<h4 id="war-form"><a class="header" href="#war-form">War Form</a></h4>
<p><em>Blatant, Protean, Mutation, Talent</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> 1 Magic Point</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Complex, automatic</p>
<p>The character's body warps and becomes a terrible killing thing. The specifics are determined when this power is learned, but many things are common: hands twist into rending claws, jaws stretch and teeth lengthen, limbs lengthen and muscles swell. The character's unarmed attacks become a damage 2 weapon that inflicts Lethal damage, although they still have the ability to use weapons normally. The character gains one point each of Strength and Agility and a point of natural Armor.</p>
<p>When a character goes into Frenzy they can (and often do) transform into War Form immediately. This Frenzy-induced transformation takes only a Simple Action and does not cost any Magic Points. A Frenzy transformation discount cannot be saved for later - it must be the character's first action upon entering Frenzy to count.</p>
<h3 id="advanced-clout"><a class="header" href="#advanced-clout">Advanced Clout</a></h3>
<h4 id="devastation"><a class="header" href="#devastation">Devastation</a></h4>
<p><em>Passive</em></p>
<p>With Devastation, raw Strength pushes beyond the raw confines of the character's grasp to sustain or destroy things around them as they will. They can lift massive things without breaking them - such as picking up a car by its bumper - or smash great holes in things, breaking through a wall like the Kool-Aid man with a single punch. For the purposes of lifting and carrying multiply the character's Strength by their Potency, as if they had an identical friend helping them lift for each point of Potency. In combat the character may strike up to 1+Potency Adjacent targets with a single attack or overwhelm a single target as if they were coordinating with as many characters as their Potency. A character with Devastation can use any weapon they can use at all in one hand with no penalty.</p>
<h4 id="giant-size"><a class="header" href="#giant-size">Giant Size</a></h4>
<p><em>Blatant, Mutation, Protean, Talent</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> 4 Magic Points</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Complex, automatic</p>
<p>The character can grow extremely large. When this power is activated they roughly double in size, with a human-sized person expanding to a muscular 3 to 4 meters in height. While in Giant Size, the character has an additional 6 points of Strength, they gain a point of armor, and the base damage of any weapon they use increases by 2 (assuming that it is allowed to grow with them). All the things that a character wants to grow along with them while they are being carried by them, and anything they aren't carrying or that they wish to leave normal size stays normal size.</p>
<h4 id="monstrous-self"><a class="header" href="#monstrous-self">Monstrous Self</a></h4>
<p><em>Blatant, Mutation, Protean, Talent</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> 4 Magic Points</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Complex, automatic</p>
<p>The character transforms into a terrifying and monstrous form. The specifics of what they become are chosen and fixed when this discipline is gained. A &quot;standard&quot; Monstrous Self is about 50% larger than their normal form, has claws, teeth, spines, or something that constitutes a 4 damage natural weapon that inflicts Lethal damage and has 3 additional Strength, 2 additional Agility and 2 points of natural Armor. With the MC's permission the character may alter these benefits to suit their particular Monstrous Self.</p>
<p>As with War Form, a character that goes into Frenzy can transform into their Monstrous Self immediately with a Simple action and no cost in Magic Points. This must be the character's first action upon entering Frenzy to count.</p>
<h4 id="telekinesis"><a class="header" href="#telekinesis">Telekinesis</a></h4>
<p><em>Talent</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> -</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Free, automatic</p>
<p>When this power is activated the character can manipulate things at a distance with a thought. Things are moved with a Strength equal to the character's Willpower, although other Clout abilities (such as Vigor and Devastation) that increase or magnify Strength increase this effective Strength normally. Telekinesis is only slightly more accurate than a grabber hand, and does not grant the amazingly devastating effects of leverage you might expect (unless combined with Devastation). With intense concentration, telekinesis can be made to perform tiny acts of fine manipulation - like writing something. When used in this manner, telekinesis is torturously slow and not very strong (Strength 1). Think of dramatic spirit writing scenes from a movie of your choice and how long it takes to write something short like &quot;Murder.&quot; On the other hand, Telekinesis is particularly effective at throwing things (doubling normal range).</p>
<h2 id="discernment"><a class="header" href="#discernment">Discernment</a></h2>
<p><em>&quot;You see what you want to see. You hear what you want to hear.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Discernment is the power to have unusual and enhanced senses. A character with Discernment can perceive what others cannot.</p>
<h3 id="basic-discernment"><a class="header" href="#basic-discernment">Basic Discernment</a></h3>
<h4 id="supernatural-senses"><a class="header" href="#supernatural-senses">Supernatural Senses</a></h4>
<p><em>Subtle, Talent</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> -</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Simple, automatic</p>
<p>A character with supernatural senses can enhance their perceptions well beyond human norms. Vision can become telescopic or even function in total darkness; hearing can become acute enough to hear heartbeats; smell can become powerful enough to track at a brisk walk; and so on. In general, the character's natural senses will be at least as good as any spyware that they could buy over the counter, so long as that sense could plausibly be applied; when in doubt, a good rule of thumb is to reduce the threshold of Perception tests by 2. Bringing one's senses into the realm of magical badassery also makes one vulnerable to intense sensory input. Bright lights can blind, strong smells can overpower, and loud noises can deafen. While a sense is enhanced, the threshold to resist overstimulation is increased by 2. The character may activate or deactivate the enhancement to any of their senses at will with a Simple action.</p>
<h4 id="aura-perception"><a class="header" href="#aura-perception">Aura Perception</a></h4>
<p><em>Subtle, Talent</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> -</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Simple, automatic (to activate or deactivate)</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Complex, Intuition + Empathy or Logic + Research vs. 5 - Potency of target/creator (to study and identify auras)</p>
<p>A character using Aura Perception can perceive magical forces and beings with Otherworldly power. Activating or deactivating Aura Perception is a Simple Action. A character with active Aura Perception can also perceive auras or halos around active Enchantments, Sorceries, supernatural creatures, gateways, magic items, and Luminaries (this property may even be why Luminaries are called that). A character can attempt to identify the Otherworldly aspect and type of a supernatural creature, magic item, or sorcery with an Intuition + Empathy or Logic + Research test, with a threshold of 5 <em>minus</em> the Potency of the target (or the creator of the target) or any Rating indicating the power of an object or gateway. Aura Perception is not dependent on the physical senses and still works even if the character is bereft of all of them, but one it's own is not very useful for mundane actions.</p>
<h4 id="sensory-damper"><a class="header" href="#sensory-damper">Sensory Damper</a></h4>
<p><em>Passive</em></p>
<p>A character with Sensory Damper is protected from harmful stimuli such as glare, pepper spray, and loud noises. They are able to dial down their sensations to the point of unobtrusiveness. This can be effectively instantaneous in the case of bright flashes, and highly selective in the case of filtering out noise while listening to a conversation across the room. Such a character can stay conscious regardless of wound level (ignoring pain sufficient to knock them out), but it does not affect wound penalties due to actual injury.</p>
<h3 id="advanced-discernment"><a class="header" href="#advanced-discernment">Advanced Discernment</a></h3>
<h4 id="chain-of-eyes"><a class="header" href="#chain-of-eyes">Chain of Eyes</a></h4>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> 1 Magic Point per link in the Chain</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Simple, Intuition + Operations or Intuition + Tactics, net hits to duration</p>
<p>The character can choose two or more creatures they can perceive and allow one or more of the chosen creatures to perceive what one or more other chosen creatures can perceive. With a Simple Action the character can add a creature they can perceive to the chain. However many creatures are in the chain, the character can decide which creatures in the chain can voyeuristically leech off the senses of which other creatures in the chain. The character can change that list as a Free Action at any time. Creatures unused to receiving sense-data directly into their mind by magic power may become confused (having a Discernment power at all takes care of this). Activating the Chain of Eyes has a base duration of 10 minutes, which is increased by net hits.</p>
<h4 id="psychometry"><a class="header" href="#psychometry">Psychometry</a></h4>
<p><em>Sorcery, Subtle</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> 1+ Magic Point</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Extended (1 minute), Intuition + Empathy or Logic + Research, net hits to time frame</p>
<p>Psychometry allows a character to view past events by touching and concentrating upon items or people that were involved in those events. The event in question must be described (although that description may well be entirely conversational such as &quot;What happened here?&quot;; in the case of a brutal crime scene, the context makes that description sufficient), and must have taken place within the last month. Seeing farther back into time can require additional net hits to increase the time frame from a basis of one month.</p>
<p>At the MC's discretion, using Psychometry on an object or scene that has extreme emotional resonance automatically reveals a vision of the contributing incidents to the character with no roll required, and then the character may attempt to discover additional information with the threshold increased by one for each such major event that they must in effect &quot;look past&quot;.</p>
<h4 id="telepathy"><a class="header" href="#telepathy">Telepathy</a></h4>
<p><em>Passive, Subtle</em></p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Extended (variable), Intuition + Empathy or Willpower + Intimidation vs. target Willpower (to read unwilling mind)</p>
<p>A character with Telepathy can communicate mentally with people within their line of sight. Voluntary telepathic messages can also be sent and received between people the character knows the name of and who they have touched (regardless of line of sight) so long as they are in the same world and within a number of kilometers equal to the character's Potency. The contents of an unwilling mind can be read, but only with physical contact and difficulty. Telepathy is always on, but mind-reading is an Extended Action that requires a test if the target resists. If the target understands telepathy and takes effort to obscure details and engages in counter thought, they can use Willpower + Intimidation or Intuition + a relevant Background for resistance. Telepathy is unnoticeable except to those receiving a communication.</p>

<h4 id="tracking-echoes-of-the-muse"><a class="header" href="#tracking-echoes-of-the-muse">Tracking Echoes of the Muse</a></h4>
<p><em>Subtle, Talent</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> 1 Magic Point</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Reflexive, automatic</p>
<p>Whenever the character is exposed to sensory stimuli, they can spend a Magic Point to know where it came from. So if they hear a phrase, even over a telephone or from a recording, they can know where in the world it was spoken. By seeing a picture, they can know where it was painted. And so on.</p>
<h2 id="fortitude"><a class="header" href="#fortitude">Fortitude</a></h2>
<p><em>Endure. And in enduring, grow strong.</em></p>
<p>Fortitude is the power to resist destruction. While some powers of Fortitude are continuously in operation and others must be activated with Magic Points, what makes Fortitude special is that it does not require the <em>active</em> choice to activate it. A character may activate their Fortitude powers reflexively while unconscious, or in some cases even while <em>dead</em>.</p>
<h3 id="basic-fortitude"><a class="header" href="#basic-fortitude">Basic Fortitude</a></h3>
<h4 id="armored-in-life"><a class="header" href="#armored-in-life">Armored in Life</a></h4>
<p><em>Talent</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> 1 Magic Point per Scene</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Reflexive, automatic</p>
<p>What passes for the flesh of monsters is often supernaturally tough stuff. A character that is Armored in Life is generally resilient even when not actively using their Fortitude, gaining Armor equal to their Potency; this ability is Passive and cannot be dispelled, but it doesn't protect against the character's supernatural vulnerability. This resistance can be doubled for a scene by activating this power for 1 Magic Point. Armored in Life may be reflexively sustained into another scene for a flat cost of 1 Magic Point.</p>
<h4 id="cleanse-the-body"><a class="header" href="#cleanse-the-body">Cleanse the Body</a></h4>
<p><em>Blatant, Talent</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> 1 Lethal Wound and 1 Magic Point</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Complex, automatic or Strength + Medicine or Strength + Survival</p>
<p>In a few seconds of strained concentration, the character forces all contaminants from their body. Bullets, shrapnel, poison, and even infections or cancers are pushed out of their flesh. The character only needs to make a test to push out substances that do aggravated damage to them (with a threshold equal to the severity of the wound) or to overcome any magic that binds something into their body (effectively dispelling the magic). Cleanse the Body will not function for drunk characters with a supernatural weakness to alcohol; as normal they cannot activate the power at all when subject to their weakness.</p>
<h4 id="patience-of-the-mountains"><a class="header" href="#patience-of-the-mountains">Patience of the Mountains</a></h4>
<p><em>Passive</em></p>
<p>The character doesn't age and need not need to eat, drink, or breathe. They persist night after night as the mountains and valleys do: never aging or decaying. Such a character can hold any position no matter how awkward without cramping or moving. They are immune to non-supernatural poison and disease. This ability is continuous. The character is still able to learn and change, and indeed Leviathan classically become substantially less human as time moves on. The one catch is that the character needs supernatural power to sustain themselves; if they do not regularly recharge according to their Power Schedule they will start to starve and wither (at a rate similar to mortal deprivation from food).</p>
<h4 id="revive-the-flesh"><a class="header" href="#revive-the-flesh">Revive the Flesh</a></h4>
<p><em>Blatant, Talent</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> 1 Magic Point per 1 Lethal or 2 Normal damage, or 2 Magic Points per Aggravated damage</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Reflexive, automatic</p>
<p>The character can heal their wounds by drawing upon their magical power. When this power is used the character's wounds suture themselves, restoring their body to its original condition without mark or scar. Each Magic Point heals one box of Lethal or two boxes of Normal damage. Wounds are healed practically instantaneously, and any wounds short of death can be healed in this manner.</p>
<h3 id="advanced-fortitude"><a class="header" href="#advanced-fortitude">Advanced Fortitude</a></h3>
<h4 id="adaptive-resilience"><a class="header" href="#adaptive-resilience">Adaptive Resilience</a></h4>
<p><em>Talent</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> 1 Magic Point</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Reflexive, automatic</p>
<p>The character can make themselves highly resistant to a threat that they are exposed to. Whenever the character makes a resistance test (including a Soak Test) against something, they can reactively use this power to gain 3 extra bonus hits on all future resistance tests against that type of thing (this does not apply to the resistance test that triggers the power in the first place). The adaptive resistance continues to function until it is again activated against a new threat.</p>
<h4 id="gift-of-health"><a class="header" href="#gift-of-health">Gift of Health</a></h4>
<p><em>Blatant, Sorcery</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> 1 Magic Point per 1 Lethal or 2 Normal wounds, or 2 Magic Points per Aggravated wound</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Complex or Extended (10 minutes), automatic</p>
<p>The character may extend their own supernatural healing to others. With Gift of Health the character can apply Revive the Flesh or Cleanse the Body (or any other power the MC considers to be appropriate) to another character with a touch. This takes additional time; increase the timeframe of any required action by 1 step. This benefice of this power does not extend to Restoration (resurrecting other characters would be an Elder power), but the character may also pay part or all of the Magic Point cost of Restoration for another character with a Complex action.</p>
<h4 id="grotesque-aegis"><a class="header" href="#grotesque-aegis">Grotesque Aegis</a></h4>
<p><em>Blatant, Mutation, Protean, Talent</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> 2 Magic Points</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Simple, automatic</p>
<p>The character can transform their skin into something very hard. It is not necessarily stone: some creatures turn into metal or magically hardened wood. Some creatures get skin that is all craggy or jointed (like The Thing or Colossus from Marvel Comics), and others simply turn into living statues. The limitation is that you can't turn into the substance you are vulnerabile to. While active, the character gains 4 bonus dice when Soaking physical damage, their Strength increases by 2, and their unarmed strikes become Lethal (or Aggravated, against appropriate vulnerabilities). Electricity does not harm a character having invoked Grotesque Aegis, either because they are too conductive (if metallic) or too insulated (if stone).</p>
<h4 id="indomitability"><a class="header" href="#indomitability">Indomitability</a></h4>
<p><em>Passive</em></p>
<p>Wounds and fatigue do not hamper the character. The character suffers no wound penalties, does not go unconscious from injury before they die, and is not affected by the Incapacitated status at all. If you have a Terminal wound you'll still bleed out, and you can still be killed outright by Death Threshold overflow, but you'll be conscious and able to act while that's all happening. The character is also capable of straining themselves severely without noticeable effect: they can carry home anything they can lift and are not subject to fatigue from mundane exhaustion.</p>
<h4 id="restoration"><a class="header" href="#restoration">Restoration</a></h4>
<p><em>Blatant, Talent</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> 1 Magic Point per Potency</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Extended (1 day), automatic</p>
<p>Death is no longer an insurmountable obstacle. While the character is dead, they may activate this power to reduce the amount of damage on themselves to one less than fatal. Even if the character lacks the Magic Points to activate this Restoration, they may get a chance if someone else is able to directly provide them with Gift of Health, The Blood is the Life, or according to their Power Schedule if it can somehow be facilitated. Notably, the Lunar Power Schedule continues operating normally, making the resurrection of Lycanthropes practically guaranteed unless extraordinary precautions are taken.</p>
<p>Restoration cannot be performed if the character is:</p>
<ul>
<li>impaled with something that inflicts aggravated damage to them</li>
<li>missing their head or heart</li>
<li>subject to their monstrous weakness</li>
<li>covered with a powder that counters their power source (if dubious, consider this power to be the equivalent of Sorcery with 4 hits to be dispelled, but dumping a 50 lb bag of rock salt on a Werewolf is always going to work unless someone cleans them off)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="guise"><a class="header" href="#guise">Guise</a></h2>
<p><em>Virtue has a veil, vice a mask.</em></p>
<p>Guise is the ability to draw upon one's magical nature to obscure things from view. Guise works just as well on cameras and other objective traces of a creature's passing, but the illusion is paper-thin. It mostly works by keeping people from <em>noticing</em> what is there. Normally, Guise can only take effect while the target is not being observed. If observation is continuous, the observers will not see any change. Onlookers do not normally have any say in what they see as presented to them by Guise any more than they have any choice to not see things that are there. Characters who have Discernment powers active or who carefully search the area that the character is in have a chance to perceive through it by making an Intuition + Perception test against the number of hits made to activate the power (Aura Perception will always note the glowing presence of magic, but won't necessarily let the user know that the source is a Guise). Anything a character covered by Guise carries is likewise covered by Guise and anything that the character stops carrying will cease being covered by Guise. An onlooker who notices an object pass into or out of Guise pierces the Guise altogether. Guise is inherently multi-sensory, onlookers are just as fooled if they close their eyes and listen or try to smell the character as they are relying entirely on their eyes.</p>
<h3 id="basic-guise"><a class="header" href="#basic-guise">Basic Guise</a></h3>
<h4 id="hide-from-notice"><a class="header" href="#hide-from-notice">Hide From Notice</a></h4>
<p><em>Enchantment, Sorcery, Subtle</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> -</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Simple, Agility + Stealth or Intuition + Survival</p>
<p>While active, the character is not noticed so long as they don't do anything incredibly obvious to give themselves away. This works just as well to keep someone from noticing what you're doing - such as picking a pocket - as from noticing what you <em>are</em>, such as a 2-meter tall clay man. So far as anyone is concerned, so long as the Guise remains undamaged the character might as well not be there.</p>
<h4 id="mask-of-a-thousand-faces"><a class="header" href="#mask-of-a-thousand-faces">Mask of a Thousand Faces</a></h4>
<p><em>Enchantment, Sorcery, Subtle</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> -</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Simple, Agility + Stealth or Charisma + Larceny</p>
<p>While active, those who meet the character will treat them as if they were a different person. The character may choose the appearance (including clothing and carried items) freely, but taking any action that would be impossible for the facade allows onlookers to see through the illusion. For example, if a character uses the Mask to appear as a person who had no gun and then <em>fires</em> their gun, people would see them as they really are.</p>
<h3 id="advanced-guise"><a class="header" href="#advanced-guise">Advanced Guise</a></h3>
<h4 id="facade-of-nonchalance"><a class="header" href="#facade-of-nonchalance">Facade of Nonchalance</a></h4>
<p><em>Enchantment, Sorcery, Subtle</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> 1 Magic Point per Scene</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Free, Charisma + Larceny or Intuition + Survival</p>
<p>When activated, the Facade prevents extras in the area from <em>noticing</em> that events going on around them are in any way out of the ordinary, as if everything happening were affected by Hide From Notice. When activated everyone in the vicinity behaves as if things are totally normal for the rest of the scene even if the actual events are completely outside their life experience or moral limits. In addition to normal ways to penetrate a Guise, taking actual damage will snap a victim out of their complacency. The Facade of Nonchalance has to be used <em>before</em> the shit hits the fan, because it won't cause people who have already freaked out to calm down.</p>
<h4 id="lost-and-found"><a class="header" href="#lost-and-found">Lost and Found</a></h4>
<p><em>Passive</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> 1 Magic Point</p>
<p>By spending a Magic Point, a carried object can continue being covered by Guise after it leaves physical contact with the character. The Guise remains affecting the object for as long as the original power would and counts as a separate Enchantment to dispel.</p>
<h4 id="hide-in-plain-sight"><a class="header" href="#hide-in-plain-sight">Hide in Plain Sight</a></h4>
<p><em>Passive</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> 1 Magic Point</p>
<p>By spending a Magic Point, the character may activate other powers of Guise while being observed. All onlookers are entitled to a resistance check as if they had been carefully searching the area, but if they fail to notice the discrepancy, their mind will fill in vague details that excuse the character's disappearance.</p>
<h2 id="magnetism"><a class="header" href="#magnetism">Magnetism</a></h2>
<p><em>Alright everyone! Let's hear it... for me!</em></p>
<p>Magnetism is the power to affect others with the otherworldly charisma of the supernatural, either to attract or repel. A character using 
Magnetism makes a large impression, and anyone asking about them later will sure to find lots of keen witnesses.</p>
<h3 id="basic-magnetism"><a class="header" href="#basic-magnetism">Basic Magnetism</a></h3>
<h4 id="attract"><a class="header" href="#attract">Attract</a></h4>
<p><em>Talent</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> -</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Complex, Charisma + Tactics or Willpower + Expression (hits to number affected)</p>
<p>The character can draw and hold someone's undivided attention. Activating Attract affects as many people as you get hits and lasts for an entire scene. Attract does not guaranty that someone will agree with you, nor does it guaranty that they will sleep with you. But it does guaranty that the target will not ignore you or discount the importance of what you say. Attracted onlookers do not actively resist the next Adjacent attack if it comes from anyone else (meaning the threshold to hit them is zero).</p>
<h4 id="beguile"><a class="header" href="#beguile">Beguile</a></h4>
<p><em>Talent</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> 1 Magic Point</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Free, automatic</p>
<p>The character can &quot;turn on the charm&quot; towards a particular target, increasing their effective Charisma concerning that person by their Potency. Beguile may be reflexively sustained into another scene for a flat cost of 1 Magic Point. While there is nothing overtly supernatural about using Beguile on someone it can come off as creepy to onlookers or if a total failure is rolled on any Charisma dicepools.</p>
<h4 id="repel"><a class="header" href="#repel">Repel</a></h4>
<p><em>Talent</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> -</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Simple, Charisma + Tactics or Willpower + Intimidation vs. Willpower or Strength</p>
<p>The character can become extremely frightening and intimidating, inspiring fear and shame in onlookers. An affected victim runs away or cowers in terror for at least a number of rounds equal to the net hits. Thereafter, an affected victim is shaken up for the remainder of the scene and suffers a -2 die morale penalty on actions.</p>
<h3 id="advanced-magnetism"><a class="header" href="#advanced-magnetism">Advanced Magnetism</a></h3>
<h4 id="betrayal-of-the-tongue"><a class="header" href="#betrayal-of-the-tongue">Betrayal of the Tongue</a></h4>
<p><em>Enchantment, Subtle, Sorcery</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> 1 Magic Point</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Complex, Charisma + Operations or Willpower + Intimidation vs. target Intuition (net hits to duration)</p>
<p>An affected target cannot speak lies. They do not have to speak at all, but if they do, the complete truth as they understand it will pour forth from them on any subject they attempt to hold discourse upon. Placing this curse on someone lasts one hour, with net hits increasing the time frame.</p>
<h4 id="mien-of-power"><a class="header" href="#mien-of-power">Mien of Power</a></h4>
<p><em>Talent</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> 3 Magic Points</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Simple, Charisma + Tactics or Willpower + Intimidation</p>
<p>The character can wrap themselves in the air of invincible unapproachability, making aggression against them or even refusal of their demands almost unthinkable. When activated the character's powerful demeanor takes hold until the end of the scene. Anyone who wishes to summon the nerve to act against them must generate an equal number of hits on a Willpower + Intimidation or Willpower + Survival test. Failure to do so results in a round lost to dithering. The character's orders are also extremely likely to be obeyed (especially if they involve moving away from the issuer), and the hits are added as a bonus dicepool on any Intimidation or Tactics tests to command or demand.</p>
<h4 id="shorten-the-fuse"><a class="header" href="#shorten-the-fuse">Shorten the Fuse</a></h4>
<p><em>Sorcery</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> 1 Magic Point, or 2 on targets without a Master Passion</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Complex, Charisma + Intimidation or Willpower + Survival vs. Willpower</p>
<p>The character can weaken the resolve and composure of the subject, sending them into panic or a frenzy of destructiveness as the case may be. If successful, the target loses their cool completely and enters a Fear or Rage frenzy (whichever is most appropriate to the circumstances). The net hits are the strength of the Frenzy.</p>
<h4 id="summons"><a class="header" href="#summons">Summons</a></h4>
<p><em>Sorcery</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> 2 Magic Points</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Complex, automatic</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Willpower + Bureaucracy or Charisma + Empathy vs. Logic (net hits to duration)</p>
<p>The character can send a brief telepathic message (able to be said in about 12 seconds) to someone whose name they know so long as that person is in the same world and no more than 10 kilometers away per point of the character's Potency. The target can then send back a brief reply. The target's presence may also be demanded by making an opposed test. If successful, the target becomes aware of where the character roughly is, and must attempt to figure out how to get there themselves. This compulsion lasts for one day with net hits increasing duration. A Summons can be disrupted at the summoning character <em>or</em> the target.</p>

But whether The Dreamlands represent an intrusion of our subconscious minds into the realm of the physical or the intrusion of an alien realm into our sleeping thoughts, the fact remains that it is a source of power that those who delve deeply into its mysteries can tap. Astral Disciplines are spells and powers that tap into that strange reality. Magic from Maya has a tendency to be as untamed and inhuman as the implacable beasts and plants that inhabit it.</p>
<p>Astral magic disturbs magnetic fields, including that of the Earth itself (at least on a local level), and a skilled augur can track and judge the strength of the magics of the Dreamlands by carefully observing a lodestone.  Astral magic &quot;feels wet&quot; to those who feel its wrath, and indeed it can be countered by judiciously throwing clean salt on it. Salt used in this manner becomes caked and discolored like it had absorbed dirty water.</p>
<h2 id="call-of-the-wild"><a class="header" href="#call-of-the-wild">Call of the Wild</a></h2>
<p><em>&quot;Be what you want to be until you don't anymore.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Call of the Wild is the sorcerous path of attuning one's self to animals, particularly wild animals (as referenced in the name). For this Discipline &quot;animal&quot; specifically excludes humans and monsters other than Giant Animals unless otherwise noted.</p>

<h4 id="beast-form"><a class="header" href="#beast-form">Beast Form</a></h4>
<p><em>Blatant, Enchantment, Protean, Sorcery</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> 1 Magic Point</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Complex, automatic</p>
<p>The character can transform into an animal. The type of animal transformed into is chosen when the ability is learned. When Beast Form is gained as a fixed ability from a character's supernatural type, the form of the beast is usually predefined (for example, a Nezumi becomes a rat). This ability can be learned again to gain a different form, or Red in Tooth and Claw can be learned to largely remove this restriction. No beast form can be much larger than a human or smaller than a mouse. Some animals are stronger or more agile than a human, but the total bonus to these attributes never exceeds +2. Many animals are <em>much</em> weaker than a human. For example: a Rat Form always has a strength reduced to 1 regardless of the original character's Strength score, and gains a +2 bonus to Agility. For purposes of being countered, Beast Form has 4 hits. As a <em>Passive</em> benefit, the character gains 2 dice on all tests to influence any animal whose form they can assume with this power.</p>
<h4 id="tongue-of-beasts"><a class="header" href="#tongue-of-beasts">Tongue of Beasts</a></h4>
<p><em>Passive, Subtle</em></p>
<p>The character can speak to and understand the speech of beasts. This is invaluable in training and information gathering. But remember that animals do not gain any special understanding of their environment even though they are able to convey their thoughts to the character. Honestly, dogs speak kind of like the dogs from <em>Up!</em> and rats and cats are no better. Most non-mammalian beasts are downright disappointing conversationalists (with exceptions made for some wicked smart non-mammals like crows and octopuses). This does mean that the character can use Authority powers on animals.</p>

<h4 id="the-beckoning"><a class="header" href="#the-beckoning">The Beckoning</a></h4>
<p><em>Blatant, Enchantment, Sorcery</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> 3 Magic Points</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Complex, Charisma + Empathy or Willpower + Survival</p>
<p>The character emits some suitably animalistic noise and calls all creatures of a specific type to their location. The character can only choose one type of animal at a time, and the power reaches out to 100 meters per point of Potency. The number of beasts that come is dependent upon how many of the type of creature that are within the area, and the urgency with which they come and the degree of control the character has over their actions upon their arrival is based on the number of hits achieved on the activation test. When dealing with large or predatory animals, the range of The Beckoning increases to 500 meters per potency. When calling large predatory animals, the range extends to 5 kilometers per point of potency.</p>
<h4 id="humbling-form"><a class="header" href="#humbling-form">Humbling Form</a></h4>
<p><em>Blatant, Enchantment, Protean, Sorcery</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> 1 Magic Point</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Complex, Charisma + Empathy or Willpower + Survival vs. Intuition (net hits to duration)</p>
<p>The character can transform a victim into a beast. This is a humiliating ordeal, and as the target doubtless has little familiarity with their new form is generally quite awkward and difficult for the victim (over and above being transformed into a frog or pig). The victim becomes a beast of the character's choice until the next sunrise or sunset with net hits increase the time frame of a victim's transformation. While this is a Protean power, the usual benefit does not extend to the victim, although the character can return victim to their real form with another use of this power. A character can't be transformed into an animal much larger than their original size, but they can be transformed into something much smaller.</p>
<h4 id="red-in-tooth-and-claw"><a class="header" href="#red-in-tooth-and-claw">Red in Tooth and Claw</a></h4>
<p><em>Passive</em></p>
<p>The character is no longer limited to a particular shape for their Beast Form, War Form, Monstrous Self, or Beast of Terror shapes, but can shape their specifics to match that of any animal whose blood they have tasted.</p>
<h4 id="beast-of-terror"><a class="header" href="#beast-of-terror">Beast of Terror</a></h4>
<p><em>Blatant, Enchantment, Sorcery, Protean</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> 4 Magic Points</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Complex, automatic</p>
<p>The character can transform into a large and powerful animal. Otherwise similar to Beast Form, the character can turn into something as large as 500 kg (or 1100 lb), such as a large alligator or polar bear - something more like a Behemoth than an ordinary animal. In such a form the character usually has a natural attack such as a bite that does at least 4 Lethal damage and the character may improve their physical attributes by up to 6 points. The type of animal transformed into is chosen when the ability is learned and may be fixed by the supernatural type. This ability can be learned multiple times, and each time the character can choose one more new form than the time before (two new forms with the second learning, for a total of 3). For purposes of being countered, Beast of Terror has 4 hits.</p>

<p><em>Ye elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes and groves,<br />
And ye that on the sands with printless foot<br />

<p>Chasing the Storm is the astral sorcery dedicated to understanding and controlling the weather. A character with Chasing the Storm knows what the weather should be for a week in advance (which means that they likewise know when weather sorcery is employed), which may situationally grant a bonus to Survival tests.</p>

<p><strong>Cost:</strong> -</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Complex, Agility + Rigging or Logic + Operations</p>
<p>The character can make winds rise or soften and blow in a direction of their choice. The hits on the activation test are applied to changing the force of the winds. Howling Winds affects an area around the character out to 1 km per Potency.</p>
<h4 id="rising-mists"><a class="header" href="#rising-mists">Rising Mists</a></h4>
<p><em>Enchantment, Sorcery</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> - or 2 Magic Points</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Complex, Agility + Rigging or Logic + Operations</p>
<p>The character can fill areas with thickening fog that obscures vision and makes things seem really spooky. Range depends on the power invested, from a base of 3 meters per Potency. By spending two Magic Points, they can create an actual weather pattern, with mists creeping in out to a kilometer per Potency from their person. The activation test determines visibility through the mists:</p>

<p><em>Blatant, Enchantment, Protean, Sorcery</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> 1 Magic Point</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Complex, automatic</p>
<p>The character can transform themselves into a fine mist. While in mist form, a character's body is essentially impervious to physical attacks, save those that are made with a weapon that the character is vulnerable to. Everything the character is carrying when they transform transforms with them, and other creatures thus transformed are essentially helpless until the character becomes solid again. While in mist form the character can fly, but they move no faster than a normal walk, and can gradually fit through any gap that isn't water-tight. For purposes of being dispelled, Form of Mist has 4 hits.</p>
<h4 id="lightning-strike"><a class="header" href="#lightning-strike">Lightning Strike</a></h4>
<p><em>Sorcery</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> -</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Complex, Agility + Rigging or Logic + Electronics (net hits to damage)</p>
<p>A cloudy sky can be split by a lightning bolt crashing to Earth. The character can direct a lightning bolt to strike an individual or object. The lightning bolt cannot be dodged, its threshold to hit the target at any range is 2, and it is a Damage 5 weapon. Once unleashed, the bolt of lightning is real electricity, and can be defended against with conductive materials in classic Franklin or Tesla fashion, or with Flesh of Marble. Nearby electronics may be damaged by the induction created by the enormous voltage.</p>
<h4 id="tumultuous-rain"><a class="header" href="#tumultuous-rain">Tumultuous Rain</a></h4>
<p><em>Enchantment, Sorcery</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> 3 Magic Points</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Extended (1 hour), Agility + Rigging or Logic + Operations (net hits to timeframe)</p>
<p>The character can pull clouds into a clear sky and rain from clouds. It takes a base amount of time of an hour to bring rain from a clear sky, and net hits reduce the timeframe. The more it is &quot;naturally&quot; clouded, the easier this is, and the character gains a +2 bonus if there are already clouds <em>somewhere</em> in the sky, raising to a +6 bonus if there is already some tiny amount of rain coming down. The weather can be affected out to 5 kilometers per Potency of the character. Once established, a weather pattern persists until natural forces blow it away.</p>
<h2 id="coil-of-thorns"><a class="header" href="#coil-of-thorns">Coil of Thorns</a></h2>
<p><em>Leaves drop in Autumn not because of the shortening of the day, but because of the lengthening of the night.</em></p>
<p>The Coil of Thorns is the Astral Sorcery dedicated to understanding and manipulating plant life. Characters who practice this magic are able to do much with practically any plant matter. Characters with Coil of Thorns can also make something edible and even delicious out of literally any plant matter. It's not at all obvious how it's done, but their redwood pasta is not bad at all. This magic is inextricably linked in the minds of many supernaturals with the Evil Plants, and indeed any practitioner can speak with Evil Plants of any kind. It has even been suggested that Dryad Witches are actually Pod spies. Most Coil spells are quite powerful but time-consuming to use. A Coil of Thorns laboratory is called a &quot;Kitchen&quot; and can indeed be created with materials purchasable at a farmer's market, or, as is the case with Evil Plants, grown.</p>

<p><em>Enchantment, Sorcery</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> 1 Magic Point</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Extended (1 hour), Logic + Medicine or Intuition + Survival</p>
<p>The character can make powerful medicines and poisons out of ordinary fruits and roots. By spending a Magic Point and an hour working in a kitchen, the character's result can be a balm or a curse to those who consume it with a strength equal to the number of hits on a Logic + Medicine or Intuition + Survival test. Such products can be made into potions or clearly medicinal pastes and the like, or covertly disguised as fresh foods such as tea cakes or shiny apples. Doses with other effects can also be produced, but if the requisite number of hits is not achieved the resulting product is merely a standard damaging poison with a strength equal to the actual hits achieved. With Advanced and Elder Coil of Thorns comes the learning of additional recipes such as making powerful acids, paralytics, or explosives. The products of Bitter Root may be dispelled, but this does not remove any effect already produced.</p>

<p><strong>Action:</strong> Extended (1 hour), Logic + Medicine or Intuition + Survival vs. Strength or Willpower</p>
<p>The character plants a seed in a victim that slowly roots into the unfortunate's brain and leaves them an emotionless pawn. Creating the Mind Root takes an hour in the kitchen, and it takes an hour or two for the tendrils to work their way into the victim (making it essentially worthless against a target that is not willing, bound, or sleeping). Once fully implanted, the victim becomes zombie-like, taking orders as if the character is using Command, but automatically fails any active Social tests and is incapable of frenzying. Once the Root has taken hold considerable damage to memory and personality has taken place that may not naturally heal, even if dispelled, unless treated with Purify the Mind or other extraordinary measures.</p>
<h4 id="plant-puppetry"><a class="header" href="#plant-puppetry">Plant Puppetry</a></h4>
<p><em>Blatant, Enchantment, Sorcery</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> -</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Complex, automatic or Logic + Medicine or Intuition + Rigging vs. Willpower</p>
<p>The character can command plants to perform actions and have the plants actually perform them at a reasonable speed. The character's plant minions will move about with distinctly non-plantlike mobility each round the character uses a Complex action to actively to control them with and effective Strength and Agility equal to the character's Intuition or Logic. The character can also give long term commands to plants, which they will go about performing at their normal speeds (often centimeters a day). Commanding sapient (and presumably evil) plants is more difficult, and requires an opposed test to physically control one of them for a number of rounds equal to the number of net hits; this also applies to controlling a person someone else has implanted a Mind Root into. Otherwise, Plant Puppetry extends to any number of plants within 10 meters of the character per point of Potency. A character with Puppetry is able to use their Authority powers on Evil Plants without the usual requirement to make eye contact.</p>
<h2 id="depths-of-despair"><a class="header" href="#depths-of-despair">Depths of Despair</a></h2>
<p><em>Bitterest of all is not the sorrow but to have one's sorrows ignored.</em></p>
<p>The Depths of Despair is a magical discipline which harvests the power of misery. In the Deep Astral there is a liquid that is literally created by the fact that sadness exists. This material is called the Tears of Maya, even though in a very real way it is the psychic residue of human sorrow from the Material World. Those who swim the depths are incredibly good at finding the clouds in life.</p>

<p><em>Enchantment, Sorcery, Subtle</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> -</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Simple, Willpower + Rigging or Willpower + Sabotage</p>
<p>Using astral sorcery, the character curses a victim to have luck abandon them at a later date. When placed, evil magic hangs like a dark cloud of misery over the target's head. At any later date, the character may reactively end this curse to force the victim to reroll all hits on a test. The Curse of Failure is totally covert, all the character actually does is look at the victim funny and the sorcery has no overt special effects (although it can be detected as normal Astral magic). If multiple Curses of Failure are laid on a single target, treat them as a single Sorcery with net hits of whichever activation had the most which may be ended by any character that laid one of the curses.</p>
<h4 id="misery-loves-company"><a class="header" href="#misery-loves-company">Misery Loves Company</a></h4>
<p><em>Passive</em></p>
<p>The character has deep insight into human misery. They gain a +3 bonus to any attempt to ruin someone's day or generally inspire sadness and despondency in them.</p>
<h4 id="pain-drops"><a class="header" href="#pain-drops">Pain Drops</a></h4>
<p><em>Sorcery</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> -</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Simple, Agility + Combat or Willpower + Rigging (ranged attack)</p>
<p>Tiny drops fall at the target, dampening not their skin but their pride. Pain Drops have a damage rating equal to the character's Willpower, and are soaked with Willpower rather than Strength. Pain Drops cause only illusory damage, and while they cause wound penalties and even incapacitation, they do not actually kill or wrap around into lethal damage. Virtual damage from Pain Drops fades in an hour. Sensory Damper and Indomitability explicitly give total immunity to this damage.</p>

<p><strong>Action:</strong> Complex, Willpower + Intimidate or Willpower + Sabotage vs Willpower</p>
<p>By belittling the target the character can provoke a Despair Frenzy regardless of their Master Passion, if any. This ability is largely covert, as it does not appear that the character did anything other than behave in a rude and perhaps senselessly cruel fashion towards the victim.</p>
<h4 id="milk-of-human-kindness"><a class="header" href="#milk-of-human-kindness">Milk of Human Kindness</a></h4>

<p><strong>Cost:</strong> -</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Extended (1 Hour), Willpower + Intimidate or Willpower + Rigging vs. Willpower (net hits to timeframe)</p>
<p>The Tears of Maya may be harvested into the mortal world through this character's actions. The character observes and concentrates on a person in terrible sadness and despair, who slowly weeps a few milligrams of milky black tears. This precious material must be carefully gathered and protected, for any touch of salt will ruin it utterly (a single success on a Dispelling test breaks the enchantment). Rather than salty and bitter the tears are deliciously sweet and fill the drinker with a subtle ecstasy that soothes the soul. A single dose of the Milk of Human Kindness gives a chance to end a frenzy and eliminates any penalty to frenzy tests for living in human society for one day. They're also as addictive as heroin, the primary sustenance of the Fae, and the only way to make Evil Plants have feelings at all.</p>
<h2 id="sea-of-stars"><a class="header" href="#sea-of-stars">Sea of Stars</a></h2>
<p><em>&quot;My god, it's full of stars!&quot;</em></p>
<p>The surface of the sea is a thin skein between twin abysses, a mirror to unfathomable depths of ocean and sky. The waters and voids of Maya are stranger still, and in the dawning times of the world Dagon mastered them all and left as his children's first birthright a mad insight into the deep and secret places of the worlds. Sea of Stars is a somewhat esoteric discipline that draws on the strangely parallel nature of the wet and starry voids.</p>

<h4 id="abyssal-grace"><a class="header" href="#abyssal-grace">Abyssal Grace</a></h4>
<p><em>Passive</em></p>
<p>The character's body adapts automatically to the extremes of the ocean depths and empty space alike. Broad pressure, whether in total absence or crushing abundance, has no adverse affect. Without other powers the character still requires breath, but at only one tenth the normal rate and with the ability to inhale liquids and extract oxygen from them with no more difficulty than surface atmosphere. The extremes of mountain air make no difference to them at all. The character gains 6 points of armor with regard to heat and cold. Finally, they experience no penalty for moving and acting in water or free fall. Abyssal Grace otherwise does not protect a character from the effects of a weakness to water or sunlight, but does continue to function even when the character is subject to their supernatural weakness.</p>
<h4 id="measure-the-stars"><a class="header" href="#measure-the-stars">Measure the Stars</a></h4>
<p><em>Passive</em></p>
<p>The character's senses are enhanced with an uncanny ability to measure the world around them and otherwise perform stunts of visual calculation and memory. Among other things, the character can flawlessly perform celestial navigation as if equipped with a suite of measuring devices and charts or make accurate land surveys at a glance. This even extends to the strange wheeling stars of the Dreamlands, and the character can navigate into the Deep Maya or back towards the Earth with little difficulty so long as they have stars to navigate by.</p>

<p><em>Blatant, Enchantment, Mutation, Protean, Sorcery</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> 2 Magic Points</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Complex, automatic</p>
<p>The character can grow additional limbs. The particular form of limb is set when learning the power; tentacles are most common, but it could be spider legs, mechanical grabbers, or just more human arms and legs, and the character's existing limbs can be transformed to match if they wish. These extra limbs are especially useful for climbing and swimming and the character can move at their base speed when doing either (multiplied by Nimble Feet as usual). The limbs are also of great use when grappling; the character is treated as being double their usual mass due to their greatly increased leverage and gets a +4 bonus to their Strength + Combat pool when performing a Grab attack. While the Eightfold Grasp can certainly let the character hold more things it doesn't generally speed up most tasks; the character is still somewhat limited in their ability to multitask and coordinate multiple limbs.</p>

<p><strong>Cost:</strong> 1 Magic Point</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Simple, TK vs. Strength</p>
<p>With a dismissive gesture the character robs their target of breath and speech. The target's lungs (or parallel organs) are filled with water or collapsed with vacuum at the character's option. In most circumstances this arrests their ability to effectively speak and causes them to begin drowning of suffocating; Abyssal Grace gives total immunity to Drowning Doom, and characters that do not need to breathe will not be fatally affected.</p>
<h4 id="water-prison"><a class="header" href="#water-prison">Water Prison</a></h4>

<p><strong>Action:</strong> Complex, Agility + Combat or Willpower + Rigging grabbing attack</p>
<p>At the character's command water or ice can be manipulated into three-dimensional shapes that hold their form and are strong as steel. Actually capturing someone with the titular prison made of water requires a that the target be within Short range of sufficient water and is resolved as a grab attack, albeit at range. Grasping water has an effective Strength equal to the character's Willpower. A character held by Water Prison is considered fully wet for purposes of magical weaknesses to water.</p>
<h4 id="starry-wisdom"><a class="header" href="#starry-wisdom">Starry Wisdom</a></h4>

<p><strong>Cost:</strong> 1+ Stress</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> TK</p>
<p>The mad wisdom of the sea and stars are at the character's disposal, for a price. For each point of Stress the character accepts (up to a limit of their Potency) they may increase either their Intuition or Logic by a point for a scene, and may continue this insight into an additional scene for a flat cost of one Stress. While any normal triggers may send the character into Frenzy during the duration of Starry Wisdom they need not resist the frenzy that the Wisdom causes until its duration is complete unless their accumulated Stress exceeds their Willpower and triggers an automatic frenzy.</p>
<h4 id="eye-of-madness"><a class="header" href="#eye-of-madness">Eye of Madness</a></h4>
<p><em>Enchantment, Sorcery</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> 0 or 1 Magic Points</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Complex, Intuition + Perception or TK + TK vs. Intuition</p>
<p>The character may share their abyssal insights with others in subtle ways, driving them to apparent insanity. As indicated by its name, Eye of Madness requires eye contact and the character must also speak to the target, but Eye of Madness is treated as an Authority power to transcend these limitations. Affected characters are subject to paranoid delusions for the duration of the power, seeing secret signs of conspiracy and danger in patterns of everyday things around them. Alternatively, the character can attempt to inflict the target with a Master Passion, but those who already have Master Passions add their Potency to their resistance pool as their existing madness asserts itself over any other. The duration of Eye of Madness is one scene, but if the character spends a Magic Point when activating the power the duration increases to a base of one day, which is increased by net hits.</p>

And yet to those who scry deeply into Maya can see past it, and in time they learn to reach across and pull things from one side to the other. A character practicing this discipline has full control over their own dreams and is able to cross over into Maya while dreaming at will, leaving their body to sleep in the mortal world while their mind explores the Dreamlands.</p>

<p><strong>Cost:</strong> -</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Complex, Charisma + Expression or Logic + Medicine vs. target Intuition, net hits to duration</p>
<p>Using astral sorceries the character makes people supernaturally sleepy. The compulsion to sleep is virtually impossible to overcome for people who are already asleep, and is at best a minor inconvenience for those whose adrenaline is pumping. Activating it is potentially covert, in that the target is not especially aware of anything other than a feeling of sleepiness. The character however produces faintly glowing dust from their hands when used. An affected target that is not already asleep will shortly pass out, and any case will not awaken for at least an hour (longer with net hits) even in the face of loud noises or shaking.</p>

<p><em>Sorcery</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> -</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Extended (1 hour), Charisma + Expression or Logic + Research, net hits reduce timeframe</p>
<p>The character can send messages and images into the dreams of another creature. The dream visions can go an unlimited distance. The character must know the name of the intended recipients, the targets must all be asleep and the character needs to dream or at least meditate on the sending. Dream Vision may be used while asleep.</p>

<p><strong>Cost:</strong> -</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Complex, Charisma + Empathy or Logic + Medicine, hits determine range</p>
<p>The character views into the dreams of a sleeping target. The character spends a Complex Action attuning themselves to the dreams of a target. The target must be asleep and within 100 meters per hit on the activation test. While so attuned, the character can make themselves appear in the dream or simply voyeuristically watch the proceedings. Denial of Privacy may be used while asleep.</p>
<h4 id="horrid-reality"><a class="header" href="#horrid-reality">Horrid Reality</a></h4>
<p><em>Enchantment, Sorcery</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> 2 Magic Points</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Complex, automatic</p>
<p>The stuff of dreams becomes the stuff of reality. The character spends a Complex Action and suddenly the physical effects of events that take place within a dreamer's dream reality draw their toll on their body. While the effects of a sexy or merely surreal dream may not even be immediately obvious upon waking, the effects of a nightmare can be catastrophically fatal. The character need only know the name of a potential victim and their location while dreaming, the ability works at any distance. The victim can fight back against the invader with whatever is in their dream, but unless they <em>also</em> have Horrid Reality, the only thing they will get from defeating their attacker is to knock them out of their dream until the following sunset. For purposes of dispelling, Horrid Reality has 4 hits. Horrid Reality may be used while asleep.</p>
<h4 id="phantasmagoria"><a class="header" href="#phantasmagoria">Phantasmagoria</a></h4>
<p><em>Enchantment, Sorcery</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> 2 Magic Points</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Complex, Intuition + Artisan or Charisma + Expression vs. Intuition + Empathy or Intuition + Perception</p>
<p>The character can shape the stuff of dreams and bring their creations into the real world as a magical illusion. The character can affect as many of the normal five senses as they wish. The illusion extends to a column with a 3 m radius and height per point of Potency, and it can be moved at any speed out to an area in line of sight by spending a Simple Action per round. The Illusion's contents can be changed to apparently react to events reactively so long as the character can perceive their own illusion and cares. The realistic nature (or not) of the illusion is determined by the test; other characters can spot the weirdness with an appropriate opposed test with a bonus or penalty applied if the illusion is something particularly believable or impossible (to their experience; a werewolf will easily believe someone can turn into a werewolf but might be suspicious if they turn into a dragon). The Illusion normally ends at the end of the scene, but for another Magic Point, the character can leave an Illusion standing until the next sunrise, but binding an Illusion like this makes it unable to be moved (though it can still react to apparent stimuli so long as it remains in its defined area).</p>

<p>The Dark Reflection is a horrible place from which few things escape. But its reach and grasp can be felt far outside the ashen pits of Limbo itself. Infernal Disciplines are those magics that manipulate and harness the taint of that parched landscape and turn them to one's own advantage.</p>
<p>The magic from Limbo is a lot like fire. It is also quite specifically malicious and it corrupts things it touches. When clean water is nearby, it discolors slightly as if ash had fallen into it. A skilled exorcist can track the power and location of magic from the Dark Reflection by consulting distilled water in a clear container. When Infernal Disciplines are cast they can be doused by throwing sand on them. Reasonably clean sand must be used - ground up silicon dioxide works. By the time the sand hits the floor it has been replaced by white and black sand.</p>

<p><em>It is hubris of the first order to name that which is not known.</em></p>
<p>There are words that should not be spoken. Mostly, these are the names of ancient unspeakable evils. And the <em>reason</em> these evils are unspeakable is because they will hear you if you speak about them. Upon learning each ability from this discipline, the character is able to choose for themselves a True Name. Abilities that function based upon the character's name only respond to that name, no matter what they refer to themselves as, and knows the name of everyone they perceive.</p>

<p>The character fills the target's heart with a litany of lies. If successful causes the target to feel intense feelings of betrayal and disappointment. If the character knows the target's Master Passion, they can incite a Frenzy. If the character knows the target's Driving Ambition, they can make them bitterly sullen and full of feelings of failure (suffering a morale penalty to skill tests until the end of the scene). And if the names of any of the target's friends and loved ones are known, the target can be made to distrust them. The rating of any frenzies, depressions, or misgivings are the number of net hits.</p>

<p><strong>Action:</strong> Complex, Intuition + Empathy or Charisma + Bureaucracy</p>
<p>By knowing a creature's name, the character can bind them in Limbo, making it even more improbable that they could escape. The threshold to escape the Dark Reflection is increased for the target by the number of hits. Only the most powerful Name Bindings applies to a target if more than one are applied. The Name Binding can be dispelled at the point in space it was literally invoked, not at the bound target.</p>

<p><em>Blatant, Sorcery</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> 2 Magic Points</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Complex, Intuition + Larceny or Charisma + Bureaucracy vs. target Intuition</p>
<p>The character hurls a victim they can see into the Dark Reflection. If three net hits are made the target can be sent into Limbo in a whirl of flame, leaving only a small scorch mark and a hint of brimstone. The character can also use this power on themselves to travel to Limbo, needing only a single hit against a threshold of 0, but once there this power does nothing to get them back out.</p>

<p>The character can tempt a victim into doing something they would never do, something wildly against their nature. This takes conversational time, and is absolutely powerless to convince someone to do something that they are merely moderately opposed to. A violation of the character's Ethical Taboos is always within the scope of Contradiction.</p>

<p><strong>Action:</strong> Extended (1 hour), Intuition + Empathy or Charisma + Bureaucracy vs. threshold 5</p>
<p>The character can summon beings out of hell and into the mortal world by calling upon their name. Creating a summoning portal is an Extreme task (threshold 5). The character must speak the name of a specific entity, who feels the tug of the attempt to bring them into the mortal world. The summoned creature must overcome the Gauntlet and any Name Binding normally with a Social Resistance test, and is not compelled to follow the thread of the summoning into the mortal world. If the creature wishes to leave Limbo, it appears before the summoner at the completion of their incantations. No special compulsion to obey or be favorably disposed to the summoner is provided by the Great Unbinding, although it's possible that an inhabitant of Limbo will offer something like gratitude for letting them out, depending on how hungry they are.</p>

<p>&quot;<em>We do not always see where we go. But we always go.</em>&quot;</p>
<p>The Progress of Glass is a path of Infernal sorcery that deeply investigates the connections between existence and the Dark Reflection. Followers of the Progress of Glass are able to handle different perspectives very easily - some would say that they have already driven themselves mad. In any case, spending so long gazing into mirrors has left them able to write in mirror writing or use reflections for targeting without penalty.</p>

<p>The character can peer into a reflective surface and see what is reflected off of another reflective surface elsewhere. The character must be within 100 meters per point of Potency of both surfaces, and must have a pretty good idea of where both surfaces are (and yeah, they have to be able to see at least one of them).</p>

<p><em>Blatant, Sorcery</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> 2 Magic Points</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Logic + Operations or Intuition + Stealth</p>
<p>The character can create and subsequently access a virtual space within a reflective surface. Things can be stored in and retrieved from the mirror pocket with relatively little fuss. This looks like a cartoon activity: the character's had passes into the surface causing it to ripple slightly and then some object is left within or drawn out - in either case demonstrably having more volume than the mirror possibly could. Magic Points must be paid to create the Mirror Pocket, but putting things in or taking things out is free. The depth of the pocket is 20 cm per hit on the test to create the pocket. A character can maintain multiple mirror pockets in different reflective surfaces, but not in the same one. Mirror Pocket can also be used to access a pocket created by someone else by getting as many hits on an activation test as the original creator, with no cost in Magic Points.</p>

<p>Shards of blackened, jagged glass rain down and tear the flesh from the bones of everyone in the area. A Rain of Glass can be sent out as a cone up to 30 meters in length per Potency, or fly out in all directions to cover a cylinder centered on the character with a radius of 10 meters per Potency. Alternatively, the character can just make all the glass withing 100 meters per potency explode and hit every target Adjacent to any of it. It does a base damage of 3, which is increased with the hits and resisted like a normal explosion (including the additional protective effects of cover).</p>
<h2 id="spark-of-knowledge"><a class="header" href="#spark-of-knowledge">Spark of Knowledge</a></h2>
<p>Spark of Knowledge only applies to complex, artificial things; it has no power to work on bodies or natural things, but moreover it has no power over the simplest of machines.

<p><em>Sorcery</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> -</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Extended (variable), Logic + Research or Logic + Electronics, net hits to timescale</p>
<p>The character can absorb knowledge and information from an object just by touching it. The base time of the action is the same as would be normally required to view the information contained, but net hits may reduce the timescale far beyond what would normally be physically possible, so the point of instantaneously becoming part of the character's memory with enough hits. The character may also hold an object to consult it in real-time as an automatic Free Action, a bit like having a teleprompter. Osmosis works just as well on books and other physical records as digital devices, but while it smooths over encoding difficulties it still requires the character to have the appropriate Languages or other Backgrounds to contextualize the information contained.</p>

<p>The character can treat sensors as extensions of their own natural senses. Without TK the character must touch a device to shift to perceive through it, but once established they may shift their perception into other connected devices with a Simple action. It is also possible to spread their senses over multiple sensors, but doing so quickly becomes overwhelming, as does any stimulation that overloads a sensor's output, as if they character were subject to <em>overstimulation</em>.</p>

<h2 id="song-of-swarms"><a class="header" href="#song-of-swarms">Song of Swarms</a></h2>
<p>&quot;<em>I'd like to help, but I'm covered in bees.</em>&quot;</p>
<p>Insects are kind of creepy at the best of times, but in the horror genre they actually are a source of wickedness and danger. This is borne out in After Sundown, achieved in no small part by Infernal magic. The Song of the Swarm is that magic and it has a great deal of internal synergy, many of the abilities within it make other abilities more useful. Being able to send insects where you want them is more useful if you can see what the insects see, and so on and so forth. Having Song of the Swarm allows you to treat arthropods as if they were smart animals like parrots or dogs for the purposes of Animal Ken.</p>
<p>Insect bites to creatures inside insect swarms are usually not much to report on, causing just Damage 1 strikes even en masse, although these strikes do not require a to-hit roll, can't be dodged, and can come from inside a target's armor where it doesn't do much good. Anything special that happens with the character's unarmed attacks apply with their insects, including injecting poison or disease or inflicting aggravated damage with Touch of Darkness.</p>

The bugs growing in the character's body do pretty much what the character wills them to do, so they can follow much more complex routes than a normal bug of their type. The bugs from a character can swarm one person at a time or carry very small objects. They take an entire round to crawl into or out of the character's body, but they take no actions to direct.</p>

The character can see through the eyes of a bug that is within a meter of their body, and can continue to see through its eyes even if the character or the bug moves away, so long as they remain within a kilometer per Potency. A character can maintain a number of separate small witnesses equal to their Intuition score simultaneously and suffers no penalties from distraction. The character can make their own Perception tests through the senses of the bugs. Small Witness has 4 hits for purposes of being dispelled.</p>

<p><strong>Action:</strong> Complex, Charisma + Animal Ken or Willpower + Survival</p>
<p>When there are insects in the area, the character can draw upon the magic of Limbo to cause a great number of comparable insects to wriggle into reality. Each hit on the activation to fill a 10-meter cube and pretty much swarm everything and everyone in that area.</p>

<p>The character's body breaks into a cloud of insects of roughly the same mass as the character. The deaths of individual bugs do not meaningfully affect the character, but the deaths of very large numbers may seriously hurt them. When they reform, every 10% of the original swarm unable to make it translate to a lethal wound. The Swarm body can be dispelled as if it had 4 hits, and however many insects are on hand at the time will coalesce into the original character (with accompanying wounds if not all the insects are available for the forced change). When the Swarm Body ends, whether voluntarily or through being dispelled, the character can elect to materialize anywhere that some of their bugs are, but any bugs unable to reach their new position within 1 Round die (and the character suffers proportional wounds).</p>

<p>The character carries hideous diseases that can be foisted upon others with a touch, a bite, or a kiss. A character with Abyss of the Body is not themselves affected by disease, and they can carry all manners of normal plagues and pass them normally. In addition, each character who has Abyss of the Body can voluntarily transmit a purely magical disease. The disease they have at their disposal to use voluntarily is chosen when the discipline is learned. A character inflicted by additional magical diseases is still immune, but has no control of its transmission. Abyss of the Body can be learned multiple times to control multiple diseases. To spread a disease voluntarily the character must touch the target, with net hits reducing the disease's DOT Delay. The spreading of disease can be dispelled or suppressed, but the immunity to disease of the character is passive, covert, and impervious to dispelling.</p>

<p>The character becomes a beacon of apathy and despair, foiling attempts by those caught in the metaphorical glow to care. Everyone affected is unable to muster an emotional response to much of anything. Frenzy doesn't happen, and all appeals to emotion and even magically created emotions fail unless the speaking character can muster more hits than the Light of Ennui. Lighting or dousing the Light of Ennui is a free action. The Light of Ennui sheds literal light in the Otherworlds, but in the mortal world it is visible only to the character and those using Aura Perception, in either case being a dim light similar to a candle.</p>

<p>The character can appear as that which is most desired by each person that sees them. In private, this is a powerful if risky tool of seduction and corruption. With multiple witnesses it is likely to create intense or even violent conflict as everyone strives over one another to possess what appears to be their heart's desire. This ability is likely to cause a frenzy in anyone with a Master Passion of Hunger, Loneliness, or Greed if they fail in an attempt to possess the character, and if conflict results the ensuing brawl is likely to trigger those with Rage or Fear as well.</p>

And yet while it is undeniable that fire provides light and warmth, protection from the monsters of the darkness and the forging of bricks and steel - that's mostly a facet of <em>technology</em>. Magical fire is a terrifying thing that rages at the limits of control and burns things down to ash. Firestarters in After Sundown are of course based largely on Carrie, and it is unsurprising therefore that fire magic spends a lot more time spreading panic and a lot less time smelting iron than controlled industrial fires do.</p>

<h4 id="fire-walking"><a class="header" href="#fire-walking">Fire Walking</a></h4>
<p><em>Passive</em></p>
<p>The character hardens themselves against the flames and no longer burns. This does not protect them from shrapnel propelled by an explosion, but does protect them from any wounds caused by heat itself. This explicitly includes invulnerability to the fire damage caused by other Walk of Flame Powers.</p>

<p><em>Blatant, Sorcery</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> -</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Simple, automatic</p>
<p>The character can conjure up flame in their hand, varying it in intensity from a lighter flame raising from an extended finger to an inferno in their palm. The fire does not burn the hand it sprouts out of (the waves of heat move away), but the user is otherwise not protected from the fire or any fires that they start. Calling, changing the intensity, or extinguishing of the flame is a Simple action that costs nothing. The character may shape the flame into a melee weapon with damage equal to the character's Potency or throw bursts of flame equivalent to a Molotov cocktail.</p>

<p><em>Blatant, Sorcery</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> 1 Magic Point</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Simple, Strength + Combat or Willpower + Intimidation, net hits to damage</p>
<p>The character can breathe great blasts of flame like a dragon. The fiery breath makes a cone up to 30 meters in length per Potency, and has a base damage of Potency with net hits increasing damage to all in the area. Breath of the Dragon is otherwise effectively an explosion of fire for the purposes of defending against it.</p>

<p><em>Blatant, Sorcery</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> 0+ Magic Points</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Simple, Agility + Combat or Logic + Research, ranged explosion attack</p>
<p>The character concentrates momentarily and something bursts into flame. Alternately, the character may have a bolt or ball of flame fly from some part of their body to explode at the target. The flames can go out to the limit of vision, but become inaccurate outside of Short range. Treat the attack as an explosion with damage equal to the character's Logic attribute, but unlike normal explosions net hits on the attack increase damage. The radius of the explosion starts from a base of 0 (affecting only the target), but is increased by 2 m for each additional Magic Point invested up to the character's Potency.</p>
<h4 id="flames-of-panic"><a class="header" href="#flames-of-panic">Flames of Panic</a></h4>
<p><em>Sorcery</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> 1 Magic Point</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Logic + Intimidation or Agility + Survival vs. Willpower</p>
<p>The character sends waves of terror into crowds of people. This magic affects every creature that the character can literally see, other than themselves (which means that they can shape its effects by voluntarily closing one eye, for example). Affected targets are panicked and stampede around irrationally for one round for each net hit of the caster. This may also trigger a Frenzy from any creature with a Master Passion of Fear.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="orphic-disciplines"><a class="header" href="#orphic-disciplines">Orphic Disciplines</a></h1>
<p>Orphic Disciplines are collections of spells and occult knowledge that draw their arcane power from Mictlan. The Gloom provides power that is dark, timeless, destructive, and really very frightening to the living. And for good reason, it truly does act as a window into one's mortality. The land of the dead calls inexorably to all living creatures, and sooner or later it will claim them all, and when Orphic powers are used, the draw of death becomes even stronger. This effect is not particularly noticeable for large creatures like humans or even dogs - the cells on the outside of your body are in a constant state of death and rebirth anyway, and even the heaviest exposure to the Gloom is unlikely to give you more than a mild frost burn. But for the very tiny and ephemeral creatures whose lives are over in a day anyway, death magic signals the end. A skilled occultist can use a bag of mayflies or the like to spot the moment that death magic is used, and to gauge the strength, distance, and direction towards the source of the Gloom.</p>
<p>Magic of Mictlan is highly antithetical to seeds, and you can counter Orphic Sorceries by throwing grains at them. Rice, wheat, barley, or maize kernels work equally well, but they have to be live grains. Remember that many commercial food products are neutralized with radiation or flash heating to keep them from going bad.</p>

<p>The character can send Ghosts from Mictlan into the material world or vice versa. An affected Ghost can be forced into the Material or Gloom worlds at the character's discretion. If the ghost has been bottled or is possessing a person or object its host must be touched for this power to take effect, but the ghost is additionally forced out.</p>
<h4 id="locking-the-gates"><a class="header" href="#locking-the-gates">Locking the Gates</a></h4>

<p>By naming a dead person or holding up a part of their body, the character can draw their Ghost to themselves unless it has been bottled, destroyed, or subsumed into a Poltergeist. The character makes a  check, with a difficulty of how exactly they can describe the Ghost they are looking for.</p>

<p><em>Sorcery</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> 4 Magic Points</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Complex, Willpower + Empathy or Logic + Bureaucracy vs. Willpower</p>
<p>The character screams a wail of pain and despair into the deepest portions of Mictlan, and draws a Poltergeist to their position. Actually summoning the Poltergeist is automatic, but character can the character can compel it to begin its rain of destruction upon a target of their choice for 1 round per net hit. After that, what the Poltergeist does from being in the material world is totally up to it.</p>
<h4 id="soul-tearing"><a class="header" href="#soul-tearing">Soul Tearing</a></h4>
<p><em>Sorcery</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> 2 Magic Points</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Extended (1 hour), Logic + Medicine or Willpower + Empathy vs. Willpower, net hits to timeframe</p>
<p>One of the more cruel necromantic processes, Soul Tearing rips the soul from a living (or unliving) host and turns it directly into a Ghost, leaving a barely living body (or suddenly inanimate husk, in the case of Animates and undead) behind. Soul Tearing requires continuous contact with the target, who must generally be willing, unconscious, or restrained. Generally, Extras become Wisps and Luminaries become Wraiths when subject to this power. The body or other husk is ripe for occupation with the Elder power Possession and offers no resistance.</p>
<h4 id="reanimate"><a class="header" href="#reanimate">Reanimate</a></h4>
<p><em>Blatant, Sorcery</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> 1 Magic Point per Zombie</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Extended (1 day), Logic + Medicine or Logic + Operations, threshold 4, net hits to timeframe</p>
<p>The character makes a body into a Zombie. A Shambler comes into existence under the control of the necromancer, and a Soulless does not. If the body was once a Luminary, their spirit is drawn back into their body, and they become a(n uncontrolled) Revenant. A necromancer can only maintain control of 2 Shamblers per point of Willpower they have. If they make more Shamblers than that, they lose control of some of their Shamblers at random at some inconvenient time in the next day or so. Remember that Shamblers don't have the capacity to follow complex orders. Reanimate can only be dispelled before the Zombie has actually risen. After that, the Zombie will have to be dealt with normally.</p>
<h4 id="zombie-mastery"><a class="header" href="#zombie-mastery">Zombie Mastery</a></h4>
<p><em>Passive</em></p>
<p>The character may exert control over zombies; as many Shamblers as twice their Willpower times their Potency, or Soulless counting them as two Shamblers each. To establish control over a Zombie that the character did not create with Reanimation (or one they have previously lost control of) the character can use a Simple action to test Logic + Drive or Willpower + Empathy vs. Willpower to exert their power over a single Zombie. As with Reanimate, if a character takes control of too many Zombies they will lose control of some of them at random over the following day, with Soulless breaking free before any Shamblers do.</p>
<h2 id="lure-of-destruction"><a class="header" href="#lure-of-destruction">Lure of Destruction</a></h2>
<p><em>Lately just gazing into the Abyss has lost its thrill. I'm pissing into it.</em></p>
<p>There is something distinctly alluring about the end. Not just that we cannot help but eventually reach the conclusion, but that indeed there is always a part of us that <em>wants</em> to. Practitioners of the Lure of Destruction are very well acquainted with doom in all its forms.</p>

<p><em>Sorcery</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> -</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Complex, Strength + Artisan or Willpower + Survival vs. Strength</p>
<p>The character sharply reduces the temperature in an area, creature, or object. Affecting an area, the temperature falls by 5 °C (or 40 °F) per hit. When focused on a living creature, this can be quite damaging. Cold-blooded creatures pass out, and warm-blooded creatures resist one Normal Damage per hit. This has no adverse effect on undead or inanimate creatures like Vampires and Animates. Temperature dropped in this way returns to normal when exposed to heat sources (such as those contained inside a mammal), but the character can maintain the chill round to round with a Simple action to keep the temperature low (continuing to damage living creatures). Multiple applications of Chill of the Grave do not stack. Chill of the Grave can be focused out to line of sight and cannot be dodged.</p>
<h4 id="bite-of-the-serpent"><a class="header" href="#bite-of-the-serpent">Bite of the Serpent</a></h4>
<p><em>Passive</em></p>
<p>The character's bite is toxic. Upon gaining this ability, the character must choose whether their poison is continuous or optional. A character whose poison is optional will have some kind of clear and potentially Vow of Silence breaking physical manifestation of their poison &quot;turning on&quot; while a character whose poison is continuous has no outward sign that their bite carries unusual properties. For example: a Strigoi has retractable serpent fangs, and they are perfectly capable of retracting them and kissing people without anything special happening; while a Soulless has a mouth that appears to just be a normal human mouth but their saliva is a deadly venom. A character with Bite of the Serpent is immune to poisons. A character who takes Bite of the Serpent multiple times may change the poison they secrete at will between available choices. The poison can be countered as if it had 4 hits, but the character's immunity to poison is covert, passive, and cannot be dispelled.</p>

<p>The character's unarmed physical attacks inflict aggravated damage.

<p>In time all is ashes and dust. When the character decides to focus on it, it happens practically instantaneously. Objects literally held by or on another character are resisted with Intuition, otherwise the threshold to affect objects is 0. Disposing of an incoming thrown piece of wood is easy (threshold 2), stopping bullets is hard (threshold 4), and corroding one's self a path through being otherwise run over by a truck is crazy extreme (threshold 6). The character doesn't have to actually touch objects to destroy them, but they are still limited to affecting things Adjacent to them. Aura of Decay can be used reflexively at a cost of a Simple action on the character's next turn just like the Dodge action.</p>

<p><em>Enchantment, Sorcery</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> 1 Magic Point</p>

<p>The character can accelerate the rush to death of those around them. By spending a Simple Action, the character can weaken a foe until they cannot even stand. The target's Strength is reduced by the net hits for one scene. Multiple Witherings do not stack, but a victim whose Strength is reduced to zero collapses.</p>
<h2 id="play-of-shadows"><a class="header" href="#play-of-shadows">Play of Shadows</a></h2>
<p><em>&quot;Spooky. Seriously.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Play of Shadows is a sorcerous discipline that governs and depends upon shadows. Darkness is in no short supply in something called &quot;After Sundown&quot; and areas with no light at all can be thought of as being like some singular giant shadow. Even extremely bright lights cause objects to cast shadows that are really quite noticeable. As such, in a general sort of way, the fact that Play of Shadows requires shadows to function is pretty much a formality. However, if characters are in the process of skydiving or are in the areas of exceptional <em>ambient</em> light, the powers of Play of Shadows can seriously be neutralized.</p>
<h3 id="basic-play-of-shadows"><a class="header" href="#basic-play-of-shadows">Basic Play of Shadows</a></h3>

<p><em>Enchantment, Sorcery, Subtle</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> -</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Simple, Intuition + Empathy or Intuition + Perception</p>
<p>The character can see and hear out of distant shadows. They can draw their senses from a pool of darkness that is within 100 meters per Potency. The threshold is based on how accurately they can describe the shadow they wish to peer out of and the ability lasts until the character wishes it to end and returns their senses to their own person. The character can see in darkness at any time (this ability is Passive and, unlike Supernatural Senses, does not render the character susceptible to glare).</p>
<h4 id="shadow-casting"><a class="header" href="#shadow-casting">Shadow Casting</a></h4>
<p><em>Enchantment, Sorcery</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> -</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Free, automatic</p>
<p>The character's lighting appears to have been done by professional special effects technicians. They can manipulate shadows and to a lesser extent light as well. This gives a +3 bonus to any attempt to become the center of attention, escape unnoticed, or just fuck with someone in an intimidating way. The Shadow Casting can be dismissed with a free action or dispelled as if it had 4 hits.</p>
<h4 id="smothering-darkness"><a class="header" href="#smothering-darkness">Smothering Darkness</a></h4>
<p><em>Sorcery</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> -</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Complex, Intuition + Larceny or Intuition + Sabotage</p>
<p>The character can snuff out lights and fires around them. Each hit allows the character to target one distinct light source (counting clusters of bulbs or candelabras as a single source so long as they're within Adjacent range of one another) and put it out completely, extinguishing any fire and ruining electric lights. Alternatively, the character can direct the Smothering Darkness to eliminate a single larger flame in which case the effect, while <em>Blatant</em>, is at least as good as deploying an appropriate fire extinguisher.</p>

<p><strong>Cost:</strong> 1 Magic Point</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Complex, Intuition + Empathy or Intuition + Stealth</p>
<p>The character can wrap light around themselves completely, becoming completely transparent along with everything they are carrying. The character still casts a normal shadow and cannot alter their own shadow while the cloak is in place. Invoking the Cloak of Shadow lasts 5 minutes, and net hits increase the timeframe. The cloak works on anything that uses light - including cameras - but has no effect on sounds or smells. The character can dismiss their own Cloak of Darkness at any time as a Free action.</p>
<h4 id="shadow-walk"><a class="header" href="#shadow-walk">Shadow Walk</a></h4>
<p><em>Blatant, Sorcery</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> 1 Magic Point</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Simple, Intuition + Stealth or Intuition + Sabotage</p>
<p>The character may reach or move into one shadow and out of another. The character must be able to perceive both shadows (Eyes of the Night works for this), but no intervening space is used, and nothing can block the movement other than dispelling. The character may take anything and anyone they or their shadow tendrils can carry, or make a single attack or grab out through the shadows.</p>
<h4 id="solid-darkness"><a class="header" href="#solid-darkness">Solid Darkness</a></h4>
<p><em>Blatant, Enchantment, Sorcery</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> 1 Magic Point</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Complex, automatic</p>
<p>The character can spend a Magic Point to fashion steel hard tendrils of solid shadow and use them to grasp, carry and tear. The darkness can extend out to a meter per Potency from its source Shadow, and has Strength equal to the Character's Intuition. The source shadow must be within line of sight of the character and the origin of the shadows can move along continuously shadowed paths at the rate of a careful walk. Solid Darkness is completely silent, and can rather easily grab someone by complete surprise. Directing the tendrils of shadow is a Simple Action. Solid Darkness can be dispelled as if it had 4 hits. Solid Darkness vanishes the next time the sun rises. The Solid Darkness can grab or disarm using its own Strength and the Character's Combat skill.</p>
<h2 id="path-of-blood"><a class="header" href="#path-of-blood">Path of Blood</a></h2>
<p><em>Given time, blood does become thicker than water.</em></p>
<p>The Path of Blood delves into the intricacies of life and death from a very liquid and visceral standpoint. Deep familiarity of this sort with blood gives advantages. It is important to note that not everything creeping in the night <em>has</em> any blood. A character or object without any blood cannot <em>use</em> Gift of Health or Blood of Acid, and cannot have Theft of Vitae or Blood Puppets used against them. Golems and Androids generally do not have blood, nor do any kind of Ghosts. However, even really gross blood like that found in Zombies or gooey sap like the stuff that oozes from cuts in Dryads or Evil Plants totally counts.</p>

<p><em>Enchantment, Sorcery</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> 1 Magic Point</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Complex, automatic</p>
<p>The character can invest a Magic Point into a sample of their own blood, allowing them to transfer Magic Points to others - even to characters who cannot normally have Magic Points or who are at their limit of Magic Points (overcharging is dangerous and each Magic Point over the normal maximum increases the threshold of resisting Frenzy by 1 and can cause Frenzy even in those without a Master Passion). The gift comes at a price, for the character's blood is also horrendously addictive like freebase cocaine. A character who has The Blood is the Life and Vigor or Revive the Flesh may use these transferred Magic Points to strengthen or heal the subject. The power transfer of Gift of Health can be dispelled as if it had been created with 4 hits, but the addictive properties of having drunk power in that manner does not go away no matter how many rice grains a character might be struck with. Enchanted blood lasts indefinitely if not dispelled. The character may also re-absorb their own blood and the power stored within at a later time, although they are subject to the same addiction.</p>

<p>The character can make accurate pronouncements about biological samples and give weird CSI tirades given access to creepy magical equipment. The character may reduce the timeframe by increasing the threshold from a base of 0. The kinds of information gained varies by the number of net hits.

<p><strong>Action:</strong> Reflexive,  Strength + Survival or Strength + Combat (to direct the blood as an attack when wounded)</p>
<p>The character can bleed like one of the xenomorphs from Aliens. Anyone who is within melee range when something inflicts damage on the character is subject to being sprayed with black caustic fluid. Little droplets of the stuff sent in such a circumstance are sufficient to constitute a damage 3 attack. If the character is conscious, they can actively attempt to get their blood to go onto a specific person as a reflexive attack. The character can also use their blood in more controlled fashions - that stuff will burn through the lock or hinges on a fire door in a few minutes. If not a Mutation, Blood of Acid may be dispelled with 4 hits.</p>
<h4 id="theft-of-vitality"><a class="header" href="#theft-of-vitality">Theft of Vitality</a></h4>
<p><em>Blatant, Sorcery</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> -</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Complex, Agility + Larceny or Logic + Medicine vs. Strength</p>
<p>The character draws blood and power directly out of a victim. Little spheres of blood fly out of the victim towards the character, who thence absorbs the droplets in some suitably dramatic fashion such as having them pop into the character's mouth or outstretched hand. Every net hit causes the victim an unsoaked Lethal damage level and if they have any Magic Points they lose one of them per net hit. This power does not cost Magic Points, and indeed the character <em>gains</em> one Magic Point per Magic Point stolen (up to their normal maximum). If the character has a Feeding Power Schedule, they may gain Magic Points even from victims that don't have any. </p>
<h2 id="symphony-of-silence"><a class="header" href="#symphony-of-silence">Symphony of Silence</a></h2>
<p><em>Silence is Deafening.</em></p>
<p>The Symphony of Silence is a set of magical music that brings things to a frozen stop. Supposedly it constitutes portions of the inevitable music that ends existence. In order to use any ability from the Symphony of Silence, the character must be capable of making music - although whether through playing a musical instrument or singing is irrelevant. Learning the Symphony of Silence gives you perfect pitch and rhythm. The other complication is that the Symphony of Silence is in fact a Symphony and characters may use teamwork to enhance their tests on any powers all the characters share, up to a limit of the conductor's Expression. The character is explicitly allowed to maintain multiple Symphony of Silence powers with a single Free Action each round.</p>

<p><strong>Action:</strong> Simple, Logic + Artisan or Charisma + Expression vs. Strength</p>
<p>The harmonics of the character's voice or instrument converge to damage a particular target. When focused on a living creature this does normal damage equal to the character's Charisma that cannot be dodged, although this only works out to Short range. Against objects, the character can do the classic opera diva trick of shattering a wine glass (or any other fairly resonant object) but can't do much against most other things. The voice of a character with Banshee Wail is impressively powerful, able to hit 120 decibels, equivalent to an Ambulance siren (this aspect is Passive and cannot be dispelled).</p>
<h4 id="missing-note"><a class="header" href="#missing-note">Missing Note</a></h4>
<p><em>Sorcery</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> -</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Complex, Logic + Artisan or Charisma + Expression</p>
<p>The character can move the apparent origins of sounds. The required music appears to eerily come from empty space, and the character can decide the origin of any other sounds as well. The character gains control of the apparent origin of every sound they are aware of within a number of meters equal to the numbers of hits times their Potency for as long as they play. So long as the character continues to make the music, the use of Missing Voice is a free action that can be used once per round and does not interfere with other Symphony of Silence powers.</p>
<h4 id="silent-toll"><a class="header" href="#silent-toll">Silent Toll</a></h4>
<p><em>Sorcery</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> -</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Complex, automatic</p>
<p>The character can suppress all sound up to the volume of the music generated, including the music itself. The noise suppressed equals to local peak amplitude, you don't have to keep track of potential spaces between notes and the like. So long as the character continues to make the music, the use of Silent Toll is a free action that can be used once per round and does not interfere with other Symphony of Silence powers. Silent Toll can be dispelled as if it had 3 hits.</p>
<h3 id="advanced-symphony-of-silence"><a class="header" href="#advanced-symphony-of-silence">Advanced Symphony of Silence</a></h3>
<h4 id="death-note"><a class="header" href="#death-note">Death Note</a></h4>
<p><em>Sorcery, Subtle</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> -</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Complex, Logic + Artisan or Charisma + Expression vs. Intuition</p>
<p>The character plays the song that ends a man. The character makes a ranged attack and inflicts lethal damage equal to the character's Charisma attribute. Death Note is resisted with Intuition rather than Strength and ignores armor or its equivalent and cannot be dodged. Unlike Banshee Wail there is no apparent source or explanation for the damage, as if the target died of natural causes. This ability can only be used if the character has already been playing for a minute or more.</p>
<h4 id="planar-discord"><a class="header" href="#planar-discord">Planar Discord</a></h4>
<p><em>Sorcery, Subtle</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> 1+ Magic Points</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Free, Logic + Artisan or Charisma + Expression</p>
<p>Travel between the worlds becomes terribly difficult while the song is played and for some amount of time afterward. The threshold to activate any power that allows travel between worlds is increased by the number of Magic Points the character spends to activate Planar Discord (with automatic powers being treated as having 3 hits and thus stopped with 3 Points). The area covered can be any size centered on the character up to 100 m per Potency. The base duration is 1 hour, with net hits going to either increase duration or reduce the timeframe of the action. Continuing Planar Discord is a Free action that can be used once per round that does not interfere with other Symphony of Silence powers, and the duration does not begin until the character stops playing. This ability can only be used if the character has already been playing for a minute or more.</p>
<h4 id="theft-of-voice"><a class="header" href="#theft-of-voice">Theft of Voice</a></h4>
<p><em>Enchantment, Sorcery</em></p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> -</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong> Extended (1 minute), Charisma + Artisan or Charisma + Expression vs. Intuition</p>
<p>The character steals away the voice, and in fact all ability to create sound whatsoever, from another. The base duration for the Theft is 1 Day with net hits going to duration. So long as the Voice is stolen, the character may perfectly mimic it. Theft of Voice may be dispelled at either the character or their victim. The character may also use Theft of Voice on themselves to become utterly silent. Theft of Voice may be ended at will in any case.</p>

<p><em>&quot;There's evil stuff going on in here. And I want in.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Supernatural creatures are in the big scheme of things rather rare. An individual Werewolf may go their entire life without ever encountering another supernatural creature (beyond of course the Werewolf that mauled them into their current state in the first place). So it's not surprising that when they do find each other they tend to make exclusive clubs. These social organizations are in many ways templated on the human social organizations that the creatures that created them lived in when they mingled in human society. And with the sheer age that some creatures possess, it is perhaps unsurprising that many of these organizations are in fact crazy old-fashioned.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a lot of them aren't really as old as their history might indicate. Sure, the Makhzen has continuity in some form back to the Babylon of the Late Bronze Age, but the largest city in the world at the time had around 100,000 human inhabitants. Even given a rough doubling for centralization, the standard supernatural population estimate for Babylon in 800 BCE would only be <strong>20</strong> monsters. 20 people does not a society make; that's an extended family or small clan. Literally everyone in the founding Makhzen court of Babylon knew each other quite intimately. Across the whole Median Empire there were less than 1,000 supernaturals, which is seriously few enough that they could all recognize one another.</p>
<p>Really complex societies - the size of an ancient city state - weren't possible among monster's until the population explosion of the Industrial Age. A billion humans means room for 100,000 monsters hidden among them, and that took more than two millennia from the founding of the Makhzen. The permanent revolution of the Cauchemar Communes spread in one way or another through all the Syndicates as they tried to grapple with the sudden explosion of both the human population and the new generations of monsters that were born of them. </p>
<p>Since then the world's population has gone from just under a billion to nearly 8,000,000,000. Roughly a million new monsters were created in those two centuries, and barely any of them have become Elders in anything resembling natural growth over time. Less than 1-in-10 make it through their first century, although the die-off slows after that time, as opposed to the rapidly increasing likelihood of death that comes with mortal aging. In the modern nights of the 21st Century Elders are a small few percent of the population even in the oldest domains.</p>
<h3 id="status-and-membership"><a class="header" href="#status-and-membership">Status and Membership</a></h3>
<p>Cults and Syndicates vary a great deal in the variety and formality of their internal hierarchies, but ultimately they all operate on a principles that some people are in and some people are out and that getting deeper into the inside means playing a game of awarding mutual respect to the other insiders. So even though there are at least 31 ranks in the Daziban and the Communes is nominally non-hierarchical a general idea of relative Status can be translated across them:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Associate:</strong> A rank indicating someone that is associated with a group but not a full member. Syndicates often, but not necessarily, have statuses that differentiate between those that are candidates for full membership and those that have no hope of advancement.</li>
<li><strong>Member:</strong> The rank of a full member or citizen in a Syndicate or acceptance in a Cult, with all duties and obligations that entails.</li>
<li><strong>Established:</strong> Minor offices or recognitions in a Syndicate or Cult that have some authority granted by the organization.</li>
<li><strong>Powerful:</strong> Local movers and shakers or diplomatic agents.</li>
<li><strong>Local Leader:</strong> The most powerful ranks of the organization within a domain. A Cult usually has a single local leader at most, while Syndicates generally have at least a small oligarchy in a major city.</li>
<li><strong>Senior Leader:</strong> The global leadership of an international organization. Each Syndicate has no more than a few dozen members at most at this level, and even a powerful Cult no more than a handful.</li>
</ol>
<p>In practice there is a major difference in the independence and respect of the local leadership depending on the size of the domain. The Archbishop of Ciudad de Mexico rivals the Anti-Pope in power, but a Bishop that runs a city of less than 50 flock is barely getting the respect due to a Palatine, although they would be likely to have a lot of independence to do what they want within their domain.</p>
<h3 id="the-rumor-mill"><a class="header" href="#the-rumor-mill">The Rumor Mill</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;I love rumors! Facts can be so misleading, but rumors, true or false, are often revealing.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Supernatural society doesn't have news broadcasts, newspapers, or newsletters. At best, you can show up to the Court of the Prince, Bishop, or Captain, or the meeting of the Committee of Public Safety to listen to the minutes and announcements, but you'll be hearing what they want you to hear. To the extent that records are kept, they are eyes-only documents, because it's imperative that mortals don't get their hands on them and/or that the monsters don't find out what you're doing. So if you want to know what's going on with your fellow hunters or predators-upon-humanity you're generally going to have to actually <em>talk</em> to someone.</p>
<p>And that means that monsters and hunters get their news from a global gossip network that traffics in rumor. There is little fact-checking when the MiGo tells you the dish from the dream their friend in Budapest sent them last night. And for all you know their friend might have been paid off by a Galatean to improve their reputation or destroy that of the Camazotz that their girlfriend is making eyes at. While the Syndicates tend to have agents monitoring mortal information sources, you can see how it's a bit of a miracle for them to have any idea what their own society is up to.</p>
<p>Getting the supernatural news is much like finding out unofficial information in the mortal world with Friendly Banter, Subterfuge, Testing the Waters, or a Social Interaction Montage, but you generally lean on Occult Backgrounds because everything is officially secret. In the best case you're already friends with someone that will happily infodump all the latest just for the pleasure of it (a valuable Contact), but likely you're going to need to do some work to stay on friendly terms with your sources, and the more status you have the more likely that you're going to be making payouts in a patron-client relationship with your informers.</p>
<h3 id="syndicate-law"><a class="header" href="#syndicate-law">Syndicate Law</a></h3>
<p>Supernatural law differs little in basic intention from its mortal counterpart. Essentially it is there to keep society and those within it safe and to perpetuate itself as a social organization. Where the Syndicates differ from most modern concepts of legal systems is that they are actually just there to preserve a very small clique. The World Crime League isn't particularly concerned with whether Thailand continues to exist, or even how many people die in Kuala Lumpur (their capital). All they care about is preserving the organization of the World Crime League and their own membership - which is only about 150,000 <em>world wide</em>. Which means that the World Crime League seriously does not have rules against many of the traditionally thought of &quot;natural&quot; crimes. They don't care if you steal, or rape, or murder, so long as it happens to <em>other people</em>. They only care if you endanger the apple cart. It's exactly the kind of system you'd think would be invented by pragmatic, immortal, man-eating <em>monsters</em>. Which of course it was. Punishments for breaking these rules tend to escalate quickly from warnings to banishment, torture, and execution. Syndicates are slow to adopt changes in human norms of government and jurisprudence was extremely harsh by modern standards even just a few centuries ago. </p>
<p>So what is it that the bogeyman fears? What things could you do that would threaten the existence of supernatural society? Well, <em>lots</em>.</p>
<h4 id="the-vow-of-silence"><a class="header" href="#the-vow-of-silence">The Vow of Silence</a></h4>
<p>Back in the &quot;old nights&quot; the &quot;Tradition of Misdirection&quot; was simply a set of informal rules that you couldn't tell normal people what worked and what didn't work as regards fighting supernatural creatures. Because even the ancient vampires understood that they would have a hard time fighting a hundred mortal humans with wooden spears in the daylight. Back then it was perfectly acceptable to openly be a Vampire Queen or whatever, but spoiling the mystery of how vampires worked to the peasantry was considered an attack on every single other vampire, and would be met with reprisals and concerted disinformation campaigns to reconfuse the issue.</p>
<p>The Vow of Silence has generally replaced the Tradition of Misdirection over the centuries. Hiding the weaknesses of monsters has become a bigger and bigger deal in most parts of the world as human populations and human technology have expanded so much in the last two centuries. These nights, giving away to the &quot;general public&quot; that vampires are real <em>at all</em> is generally considered to be as bad as telling people the specific types and weaknesses of vampires was in ages past. The 18th and especially 19th centuries were marked by some awe inspiring blood baths of supernatural creatures at human hands - the Wolf Khans are apparently <em>all dead</em>. And the reaction of most Syndicates has been to hide more than just their specific Achilles Heels, and in modern nights the general assumption is that human scientists could figure out the weaknesses of Werewolves or Strigoi quite rapidly if they ever started investigating the matter. So if someone were to leave strong evidence of the supernatural, most Syndicate responses are going to be to discredit that evidence (by destroying it, making it look faked, suppressing it in the news, or whatever), and to punish those involved to the point that it encourages others to not do that kind of thing in the future. And yes, if a Makhzen Prince has to do a lot of work to suppress some Vow of Silence Breech, they are well within their rights to have the perpetrator killed.</p>
<p>But not everyone sees it that way. The Shattered Empire and the Covenant Domain of Ciudad de Mexico hold that the &quot;good old nights&quot; where a Witch could have their own Witch Tower and have a fearful populace pay tribute to them and come groveling to them when they wanted some magic done can be achieved again in the here and now. These groups hold to the old ways of Misdirection where freaking the mundanes is acceptable and even in cases <em>encouraged</em>, but this does not mean that the wearing of masks is not practiced - just that the masks worn are those of prophets, gods, and demons rather than masks of mortal men. Needless to say, this is quite a sticking point between Syndicates and domains - with the proponents of the &quot;new&quot; Silence claiming that the proponents of the &quot;old&quot; Misdirection are inviting the downfall of everyone by opening themselves up to scientific inquiry, while the proponents of the &quot;old&quot; Misdirection counter back that the &quot;new&quot; Silence endangers everyone because the big secret can't be kept forever and in the absence of a body of misinformation the truth will become weaponized in mortal hands.</p>

<h4 id="the-posthuman-agenda"><a class="header" href="#the-posthuman-agenda">The Posthuman Agenda</a></h4>
<p>Once in a while someone reinvents the idea that we should make everyone into powerful immortals because death is bad. While this is an admirable sentiment, in the realm of horror that is After Sundown the problem is that 99.99% of people would either die or go absolutely crazy if you tried to expose them to the glorious radioactive hellfire that makes someone a Fallen. Being a Luminary monster might be a great deal for some people, but it just isn't an option for most. So it's actually somewhat heroic for players to stop a mad scientist from violating the rules of their horrific societies by trying to mass-produce immortality serum.</p>
<p>The Extra/Luminary divide is an unrealistic and deeply unfair aspect of After Sundown's game world that makes a good fictional setting for modern horror. Of course, if you <em>want</em> to play in a post-human galaxy of horror movie monsters, we'd love to hear how it goes.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="the-peace"><a class="header" href="#the-peace">The Peace</a></h4>
<p>Wild West style combat and intimidation doesn't really work to keep society together - it drives people away and it drives supernatural creatures away too. And while there have been Syndicates in the past based on the &quot;might makes right&quot; principle where the strongest were allowed to eat the smaller at any time, those Syndicates are simply not <em>around</em> any more. The fact is that for any Syndicate to hold together it has to offer a better shot at surviving to the end of one's immortality than simply hiding under a rock in the wilderness. Otherwise, even moderately rational supernatural creatures are just going to run for the hills. And so it is that Syndicates find themselves charged with protecting their members - and quite often protecting their members from <em>other members</em>. This means firstly that murdering other members is highly discouraged, but it also means that every Syndicate has a forum for handling grievances such that creatures will feel properly (or at least minimally) satisfied without chopping anyone's head of.</p>
<p>It's also important to note that Syndicates are not noble altruistic organizations that aim at &quot;might for right&quot; principle like some shadowy Knights of the Round Table. At their best the Syndicates operate on a cynical &quot;right makes might&quot; principle, in that being on the correct side of the rules (as opposed to just being on the side of the people that enforce them...) means that you'll be backed up by the power of the group in a conflict. Rules in any Syndicate tend to be both draconian and laissez-faire, since they are designed by and to appeal to literal monsters from before anyone had written <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Theory_of_Justice">A Theory of Justice</a>. But it is important to remember that even these rules are not as kill crazy as unfettered mob justice. </p>
<h4 id="respect"><a class="header" href="#respect">Respect</a></h4>
<p>Being a member of a Syndicate isn't just a list of &quot;Thou Shalt Nots&quot;. It's also a set of perks. First of all, it lets you hang out with creatures that are actually in your peer group, which is <em>awesome</em>, but membership also straight up has <em>privileges</em>. Members of the World Crime League receive shares of criminal proceeds, can call upon the organization to give them legal counsel, and get access to the secret swimming pool where you can let it all hang out, even if &quot;it&quot; is a set of gills.</p>
<p>But perhaps the biggest perk that any Syndicate can offer is the respect and obedience of other members of the Syndicate. And that in turn becomes one of the most important concessions that one makes by joining a Syndicate. The Makhzen promises its members that if they work their way up to Prince of a domain that they'll be able to make the rules for that domain, and that other members of the Makhzen <em>will follow those rules</em>. And thus, every member of the Syndicate is expected actually honor the perks that other members have earned within the Syndicate. You have to act like everyone else has their carrots for you to receive yours. Telling the Quartermaster of a World Crime League territory to go fuck themselves can get your pool privileges revoked - or even get you booted from the Syndicate's protection altogether.</p>
<p>The other critical aspect of respect is a degree of protection for the things you care about (besides your life; that's covered under peace). While the Syndicates might seize things for back taxes or in time of war, you can generally see to it that your friends and family are off limits. The Syndicate probably won't take threats or harm to them as seriously as it would to you, but it makes a big difference when the ghouls promise not to eat them in particular. The unfortunate side is that most Syndicates only recognize other people, at best, as the property of monsters. The Makhzen doesn't really care about your sister; they care that one of the Kin <em>owns</em> her, and you'll have to assert that if you want her to be protected.</p>
<h4 id="outsiders"><a class="header" href="#outsiders">Outsiders</a></h4>
<p>Syndicate law doesn't just recognize the rules of peace and respect, but has a formal recognition that some people are <em>outside</em> of the law and the rules <em>do not</em> apply to them. All of the existing Syndicates have formal treaties with each other recognizing that each other's citizens deserve at least a modicum of freedom from violence in the name of not having an all-out war between Syndicates, if only because such a war would endanger the Vow of Silence and thus get everyone killed.</p>
<p>And that's the one rule you aren't allowed to break as an outsider. So long as the Marduk Society, Shattered Empire, and King with Three Shadows stay under the mortal radar the Syndicates keep any wars with them cold, and so peace reigns to a degree. You can oppose them openly, but there are rules of engagement under which you are not supposed to start shooting them unless they attack you first, and the diplomats will still scowl at you over it when they find out.</p>
<p>But if anyone starts going loud about the supernatural they generally get one chance at most to join up and shut up. All four modern Syndicates recognize a state of outlawry and are quite happy to assign it to any violators of the Vow of Silence, in many cases well after they are already dead. Not only are outlaws not subject to the protection of their laws, those laws usually forbid associating with them or giving them aid. Killing and eating someone that broke the Vow of Silence isn't just permitted, it's <em>praiseworthy</em>, so long as you keep it quiet.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="the-makhzen"><a class="header" href="#the-makhzen">The Makhzen</a></h2>
<p><em>&quot;Lack of loyalty is one of the major causes of failure in every walk of life.&quot;</em></p>
<p><strong>Probably Established:</strong> 8th century BCE, Persia</p>
<p>The Makhzen is, according to its own history, an ancient truce declared between various supernatural creatures long ago in Babylon. It was apparently put together in the face of some grave threat which is no longer talked about. Members of the Makhzen are called &quot;Kindred&quot;, and the regional leadership is divided into &quot;cities&quot;, &quot;domains&quot;, and &quot;kingdoms&quot; all of which terms are used interchangeably. Regional leadership is held by a Mehtar Council, which powerful kindred are appointed to for life, and this council is led by a Prince or Aval (both are unisex terms which predate their use in royalty). How much influence the prince actually has varies from region to region. A Mehtar or prince who travels to another domain is automatically a member of the Mehtar council wherever they happen to be.</p>
<p>Laws of the Makhzen are hopelessly baroque, and most of the old ones are shockingly specific and draconian and inscribed into clay tablets. They have by and large been repealed and replaced with ones which are easier for everyone to get along with. Still, there are some hangers on, as it is widely reported that it is still technically a death sentence for the perpetrator and their three closest friends to steal an aurochs from a member of the kindred.</p>
<p>Tonight, the Makhzen remains strong in the Middle East and North Africa. It has spread somewhat into North America in the American South. Once it extended the entire length of the Silk Road and all through Southern Europe, but both of these areas have broken off over the centuries. If you go West or North from Bulgaria you get into Covenant territory. And if you go North or East from Tajikistan and Uzbekistan you get into Communes territory. The Makhzen is bordered on its southern reaches in the old world by World Crime League territory. It is a noticeable source of contention that from the Makhzen's founding lands in Persia you can literally see Afghans who work (albeit unknowingly) for the WCL.</p>
<h3 id="power-and-office-in-the-makhzen"><a class="header" href="#power-and-office-in-the-makhzen">Power and Office in the Makhzen</a></h3>
<p><em>No one wants it to be easy to depose a king. Then there would be no luster left in <strong>becoming</strong> king.</em></p>
<p>Nominally of course, the Makhzen appoints all possible positions and titles to members from above. Even the Inner Circle members are appointed by the Inner Circle. In practice, it is entirely possible to rise on one's own merits and decisions in a myriad of ways. The most obvious is that if you go set up a Makhzen kingdom somewhere, you are the Prince. And it is pretty difficult to get rid of a sitting Prince. Similarly, a character can appoint themselves for pretty much any need for which there is a void. Like in any system of government, the first rule is that you have to want to do it.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Inner Circle:</strong> The Makhzen is led by a shadowy cabal that meets several times a year. There are supposedly seven members, and their edicts are the Law. In practice they are severely limited by the fact that they have very little ability to enforce their edicts, given that almost all real power in the Makhzen exists at the level of an individual city, but their word does carry considerable respect in most domains, if only for lip service.</li>
<li><strong>Hakim</strong> Each of the Inner Circle members is allowed one <em>Hakim</em>, a roving one-person supreme court who dispenses justice and interprets the laws of the Makhzen. The Hakim serves as long as their nominating Inner Circle member allows. Their authority is theoretically unlimited but in practice they need to behave quite diplomatically towards local Princes and Councils.</li>
<li><strong>Manadi:</strong> The original purpose of the Manadi was to carry mail, bells (yes, really), edicts, and diplomacy from one city in the Makhzen to another. Tonight, with the advent of airplanes and email, there is a lot less need for these sorts of activities and there are many less Manadi than there once were. But they retain their function as bearers of the will of the Makhzen, and they are now roaming courts - like a Hakim-lite and serve a critical role as intercity diplomats.</li>
<li><strong>Prince:</strong> The leader of a Makhzen city is the Prince. All appointments in the city are done by the Prince, though in many cities the Mehtar Council wields such power that their &quot;recommendations&quot; are essentially rubber-stamped by the Prince. The title varies a bit in actual usage with older domains favoring &quot;Aval&quot; or &quot;Princeps&quot; and newer domains &quot;Chairman&quot; (the Makhzen tend to have an outdated approach to gender-inclusive language).</li>
<li><strong>Mehtar:</strong> Anyone who achieves sufficient gravitas within the Makhzen is afforded the honorary title of Mehtar, which they hold in perpetuity (although it is left unacknowledged while they have any other title - no one would bother citing the fact that a Hakim is also a Mehtar). Whenever a city's Council meetings are called, any Mehtar who wants to can show up. Even Mehtar who don't live in the city. In some cities the Mehtar council, or even specific Mehtar, have more real authority than the Prince. In others, the Council's statements are just advisory and the Prince's word is final.</li>
<li><strong>Vizier:</strong> Some Princes or Councils take a tremendously hands-on approach to government, and others don't. Some cities employ one or more Viziers, whose job it is to do administrative work that the higher ups can't or don't want to do. In Dubai there are many Viziers, and they are often empowered to administer the many mundane business operations that the Makhzen controls. On the flip side, the Prince of Khartoum does not keep any records at all and there are no Viziers.</li>
<li><strong>Sheriff:</strong> Most kingdoms employ a Sheriff, who is someone entrusted to keep the Traditions and enforce the Law. In larger, more media-savvy cities like Houston, the Sheriff will have several Viziers assigned to help them. In many ways a Sheriff is like a Hakim that answers to the Princeps rather than a Circle member.</li>
<li><strong>Kindred:</strong> A monster that has been formally welcomed into the Makhzen &quot;family&quot;. Kindred are expected to obey their superiors and honor them with tribute (10% is considered acceptable) but also receive hospitality and protection.</li>
<li><strong>Childe:</strong> A newly created monster is considered to be the Childe of the Kindred that created them or sponsors them for membership in the Makhzen. They are effectively considered to be extensions of that Kindred until formally released and/or recognized in the court of the Prince. Spawn monsters are not normally granted such recognition and remain the Childer of their creator or become the Khadim of another Kindred.</li>
<li><strong>Khadim:</strong> A &quot;Servant&quot; of a Kindred. Offenses, including insults, against Khadim are punished as an assault on the property of the Kindred that &quot;own&quot; or sponsor them, meaning that the Khadim have a degree of official protection but are otherwise accorded little respect or status</li>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="the-covenant"><a class="header" href="#the-covenant">The Covenant</a></h2>
<p><em>&quot;A bishop of the Covenant can believe anything, but most of us don't.&quot;</em></p>
<p><strong>Probably Established:</strong> 5th century CE, Rome.</p>
<p>The effect of the Roman Catholic Church on human history is hard to over estimate. As Rome itself was coming crashing down, Europe was largely cut off from the Middle East, Africa, and points further in Asia. Europe became isolated, and the influence of the Makhzen all but vanished. It was at this time that the supernatural creatures of the European region created a new organization modeled on the fledgling Roman Catholic Church.</p>
<p>The Covenant has extremely confused theology and you are specifically not allowed to be excommunicated for heresy. After all, the Covenant's primary role is to facilitate social interaction and conflict resolution between members rather than to advance any specific theological agenda. The Covenant is led by an Anti-Pope who wears a mask and whose identity is nominally secret. The Anti-Pope leads the council of Cardinals, from whom he or she is nominated, and does so for an unspecified amount of time before being replaced - occasionally by themselves in a different mask. Below the cardinals are bishops, below bishops are priests, and everyone else is referred to as &quot;Flock&quot;. Other organizations refer to Covenant members derisively as &quot;Sheep&quot;.</p>
<p>Law in the Covenant is confusing and pre-baroque, grounded in Roman law and medieval superstition. It is doctrine in the Covenant that canon law is infallible, and thus no law is ever replaced or contradicted. The immense amount of doublethink required to make this function at all is produced by Glossators, who philosophize the inordinately convoluted structures whereby contradictory statements can be rationalized as merely <em>seeming</em> to contradict each other. Canon law itself is crafted by a group of bishops called the Heresiarchs who draft documents for potential Anti-Papal blessing. Who sits on the Heresiarch council at any time is highly variable, as a seat becomes vacant whenever a Heresiarch misses two meetings in a row, and an empty seat is filled as soon as seven bishops not on the council,  three bishops on the council, or the Anti-Pope nominate one of the other Bishops into the seat.</p>
<p>The Covenant maintains a number of parallel hierarchies in addition to the primary one. Rather than being a bishop or priest (which is regional), one could be Apostolic Exarch (which governs a region that is not under Covenant Control), a Military Ordinal (which handles defense of the order regardless of location), or a Palatine (which is organizational and has personnel but no fixed territory). All of these titles carry approximately the same weight as Bishop. The Covenant also recognizes some of its members as &quot;saints&quot;. Once a Covenant member has descended into sainthood they carry a status that <em>cannot be taken away</em>, which essentially allows them to speak and be listened to on any issue by any church conclave at any organizational level. Since the membership of the Covenant are supernatural in nature, the requirements of miraculous activities is entirely a formality and being recognized by the Anti-Pope as a Saint is entirely political. Saints are given spiffy blood red uniforms when they serve in any official capacity and are thence known as Sanguines regardless of their rank or duties. World wide there are about a hundred bishops or bishop equivalents, and the substantial majority are in Europe.</p>
<h3 id="power-and-office-in-the-covenant"><a class="header" href="#power-and-office-in-the-covenant">Power and Office in the Covenant</a></h3>
<p><em>You think you're bigger than God? Let me tell you, <strong>I</strong> am bigger than God.</em></p>
<p>The Covenant is an Ecclesiastical organization, and despite the fact that a majority of its members (and even leaders) do not believe in the theology on which they were founded, their structure has remained mostly constant. More so than the human church upon which they were originally based. The Covenant hierarchy is pretty rigid even if their apologetics are not. Promotion is always from above with the singular exception that the anti-pope is promoted from within by a democratic quorum of the Heresiarchs. The organization's concept of &quot;above&quot; is slightly counterintuitive, as it is divided into orders whose offices are parallel in rank and function.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Anti-Pope:</strong> The head of the Heresiarch's Council, the Anti-Pope is the first sentence and the final answer. Currently the Anti-Pope rules from the shadow city under Rome, but there is <em>strong</em> current of opinion that it should move to Ciudad de Mexico as that city has more than 8 times as many actual Covenant members in it and basically determines the Covenant's overall direction in a very real way.</li>
<li><strong>Bishop:</strong> The ruler of each Covenant City is the Bishop. Bishops can run their cities pretty much however they want, and appoint (or approve) all of the Priests in their territory.</li>
<li><strong>Cardinal:</strong> Some Covenant cities have a Cardinal instead of a bishop (or in weird cases, mostly in Italy, <em>in addition</em> to the Bishop). The Cardinal is a Bishop (or Bishop equivalent such as Prelate or Palatine) and also has more authority in the running of the Covenant globally. They are the Heresiarchs and when the Anti-Pope dies or resigns they meet to elect a new one. Most anti-papal decrees are actually drafted by the Heresiarchs (either singularly or in groups) and then approved by the Anti-Pope.</li>
<li><strong>Apostolic Exarch:</strong> An Apostolic Exarch is given the same respect due to a Bishop, but they do not control a city. They are given supervision of a region that the Covenant <em>do not control</em>. In ages past, an Apostolic Exarch was appointed &quot;over&quot; a hostile region with the understanding that if they could attract enough Covenant members to crusade against it to conquer it and make it a Covenant territory that they would automatically become the Bishop of that land. Tonight that practice has been officially abandoned by Covenant leadership, and an Apostolic Exarch is essentially an ambassador to another Syndicate. They speak for the interests of Covenant flock persisting or working in territories acknowledged as belonging to another Syndicate.</li>
<li><strong>Military Ordinal:</strong> The Crusading Army of the Covenant has at times consisted of most of the Covenant's flock. The Anti-Pope divides the Crusading Army into military orders, and the leader of each order is essentially a Bishop. Anyone can ask for acceptance into any military order at any time, and if accepted they essentially answer to the Military Ordinal of it <em>instead</em> of the Bishop of whatever parish they happen to be in.</li>
<li><strong>Prelate:</strong> The Covenant has a number of contemplative orders, each headed by a Prelate. These Prelates are roughly equivalent to a Bishop, save that they are in charge of an order rather than a region. Like with military orders, a member of the Covenant can apply to join a contemplative order, and if accepted, is considered to be &quot;in&quot; the order <em>instead</em> of the city they happen to persist in.</li>
<li><strong>Palatine:</strong> A Palatine is an arbiter of Covenant Law. It is their responsibility to make decisions based upon the sum total of Anti-Papal decrees, to resolve differences between flock members and inflict punishments on those who have been accused by Bishops. Palatinate Courts move around a lot. Even the largest Covenant City (Ciudad de Mexico) only has about 5000 in its Flock and there aren't cases demanding their attention all of the time.</li>
<li><strong>Priest:</strong> The Covenant requires each member of the Flock to check in with a member of the Church authority at least once a week. This ritual of intrusive government is handled by a Priest. Many Bishops have several Priests working under them. Each Priest will be assigned some members of the Flock to keep an eye on so they can deliver weekly reports on interesting developments to the Bishop. But a Priest isn't <em>just</em> a member of the secret police, they also serve a leadership and administrative function.</li>
<li><strong>Monk:</strong> A Monk is roughly equivalent to a Priest in rank, but is a member of a military or contemplative order and is expected to act as a military coordinator for their personal flock (who need not be geographically located), or as a coordinator of whatever the contemplative order does (again, possibly in a non-geographical manner). Some orders bestow the rank of Monk on every member who joins after a period of apprenticeship.</li>
<li><strong>Deacon:</strong> A general term for a number of offices that, like Monk, are formally of less rank than a Priest but in effect often equivalent to them. Deacons tend to be enforcers, administrators, or diplomats working directly for Bishops or the equivalent.</li>
<li><strong>Glossator:</strong> A Glossator is similar to a lawyer. They assist Palatines with the making of legal decisions by crafting arguments (called &quot;Glosses&quot;) that indicate how a situation could be reconciled with all previous Anti-Papal edicts such that none of the edicts contradict each other. Some of the logic is quite as tortured as those found guilty of breaking the edicts. Glossators follow adversarial principals in law, and an accused brought before a Palatine is permitted a Glossator to argue on their behalf.</li>
<li><strong>Flock:</strong> The remainder of the Covenant are the Flock. Formally this means that they have undergone a baptism, which involves a good deal more literal blood than the Christian version. The Flock are expected to make tithes and regular &quot;confessions&quot; to a Priest but are also entitled to sanctuary and charity.</li>
<li><strong>Catechumen:</strong> Candidates for the Covenant are called Catechumen. They are normally presented to (preferably) the local Bishop or at least to a Priest for instruction for a time before their baptism by their creator or sponsor.</li>
<li><strong>Oblate:</strong> Anyone associated with the Covenant but not a candidate for baptism is regarded as an Oblate. They have a degree of formal protection under Covenant law but no other rights.</li>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="the-world-crime-league"><a class="header" href="#the-world-crime-league">The World Crime League</a></h2>
<p><em>&quot;Don't tell me that you're innocent. Because it insults my intelligence and it makes me very angry.&quot;</em></p>
<p><strong>Probably Established:</strong> 13th century CE, Dai Viet.</p>
<p>With the encroachment of the Mongols into South and Southeast Asia, the kingdoms remaining outside the Khan's grasp were cut off from trade with the outside world. The supernatural creatures of the region were forced to make their own way, without influence from the old power structures. A pirate navy formed in Southeast Asia, which preyed upon naval traffic and helped fight the Mongol Empire alongside the mortal forces of Emperor Trần Nhân Tông. Keeping themselves on a military, outlaw footing kept the Mongols out of their lands and waters for as long as the Ming dynasty stood, but by the time they had reestablished connections with other Syndicates, the Viet Shadow Kingdom had power of its own and its membership had no real desire to rejoin the Makhzen. They instead took their criminal activities world wide and became the League of Pirates, and eventually the World Crime League.</p>
<p>Because of their piratical roots, the World Crime League has a vaguely naval structure at the top. There is a council of Captains who discuss world issues and update the guidelines. Locally, WCL members infiltrate whatever criminal groups happen to be active in the region and modify themselves appropriately. WCL members have risen to high ranks in Triads, Vory, Mafia, and Ghost Cartels. </p>
<p>The WCL values money and other trappings of human temporal power as well as mystical power, and one can literally purchase their way up in the ranks of the Syndicate. The group holds that breaking the laws of man and corrupting the values of human society is a goal in and of itself, and undermining the rule of law and morality is seen as a powerful and respectable achievement by the League.</p>
<h3 id="power-and-office-in-the-world-crime-league"><a class="header" href="#power-and-office-in-the-world-crime-league">Power and Office in the World Crime League</a></h3>
<p><em>Honestly, it's more like a set of guidelines...</em></p>
<p>The World Crime League officially rewards and expects ambition from its members, but it also requires success (or at least the appearance of success) from its leadership. A title is bestowed for a minimum amount of time, after which <em>anyone</em> can challenge them for the post, with most challenges being settled by election (though some being up for other demonstrations of fitness, including trial by combat in some instances). If someone fails to unseat an office holder, they may not challenge for a seat for an amount of time equal to the amount of time the office would have been guaranteed. This system is an amalgamation of the Chinese Imperial Examination system and the pirate government that it grew out of.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Captain:</strong> Each territory has two separate leaders. The Captain or Thuyền Trưởng is in charge of the military of the territory and also justice within its borders. Holding the Captaincy makes one the &quot;stick&quot; in all incentivisation. Perversely, this makes the Captain usually rather well-liked, as physical punishment is rarely used and the WCL is not often at war with anything or anyone.</li>
<li><strong>Quartermaster:</strong> The Quartermaster or Giám Lộ Trưởng rewards members of the organization for their activities and distributes resources. They provide the &quot;carrot&quot; of incentives for the WCL. Quartermasters are almost universally hated and feared, because every member of the WCL gets some portion of the resource distributions and feels that they personally don't get enough.</li>
<li><strong>Councilor:</strong> Each territory can send one member to negotiate on their behalf when councils are called. Traditionally, the Captain would go to a council of war (called a Bình Thân) and the Quartermaster would go to a council of administration (called a Diên Hồng). In more recent nights, with councils becoming almost a continuous affair over one thing or another, it has become standard to have other members take the mantle of Councilor. There is talk of making the Councilor a permanent capacity, and some territories that are very far from Malaysia have already done so. The Councilor of San Francisco basically lives in Singapore and is always on hand to argue San Francisco's position the moment a council is called. The success of this program has prompted imitators.</li>
<li><strong>Minister:</strong> Anyone put in charge of anything is technically a &quot;Minister&quot; (Bộ Trưởng) of something or other. Broadly speaking, there are five <em>kinds</em> of Ministers, who each get a different insignia. The categories (and their insignia) are Military (Peacock), Law (Elephant), Wealth (Cat), Territory (Water Buffalo), and Sorcery (Swastika). Fitting modern concerns into these five categories is sometimes rather a stretch, and there are instances where essentially identical roles are given different insignia even within a single city's organization.</li>
<li><strong>Military Minister:</strong> Originally given to military officers, the peacock is now given to those who help enforce adherence to The Code and those who work on keeping knowledge and weaponry on hand to battle &quot;rogue elements&quot; such as Demons and Pods. So for example, the San Francisco Territory has a Minister of Comparative Biology whose job it is to keep samples and conflict testimonials to aid in investigations of potential invasions from other worlds. And while he does not carry a weapon of any kind, his insignia is a peacock.</li>
<li><strong>Law Minister:</strong> The World Crime League has crime <em>in its name</em>, and takes this sort of thing very seriously. Law Ministers in the WCL are mostly concerned with <em>bypassing</em> the laws of human society rather than enforcing the code of the WCL (that's a job for the military). So for example, in the Territory of Kabul they have several Ministers of various opium schemes, and they all get the elephant because their proximal job is to keep WCL members from getting destroyed or captured by mortal governments or tribes.</li>
<li><strong>Wealth Ministers:</strong> The World Crime League has quite substantial taxation, substantially more so than the Covenant's 10% Tithe. The cat emblem goes on any Minister who manages collection or distribution of the WCL's considerable financial resources. Wealth Ministers of one type or another are the ones who actually underwrite new ministries when they are created. The Quartermaster of a Territory directly commands any Wealth Minister that operates in their jurisdiction.</li>
<li><strong>Territory Minister:</strong> Originally they were ministers of &quot;agriculture and geography&quot; and their job was to manage the food sources (including the more... <em>special</em> food sources) of members as well as making sure that things weren't falling apart in the villages and keep maps of the world for the Syndicate. Tonight you can get maps on Wikipedia and most food shows up in grocery stores without Witches having to do anything. So the Territory Ministers have gradually become news gatherers and event watchers. These nights, the water buffalo is virtually synonymous with &quot;spy&quot; and many Ministers keep their insignia hidden from everyone but the Quartermaster and possibly the Captain.</li>
<li><strong>Sorcery Ministers:</strong> Purely magical concerns, such as a portal network or prophecy sets have Sorcery Ministers appointed to govern them. It is important to note that in most places the WCL is strong, the swastika is not considered a problematic symbol, and in any case it's supposed to be hidden from mortals. So really, the WCL hasn't had a problem with it.</li>
<li><strong>Lieutenant:</strong> the World Crime League really recognizes two types of Lieutenants. The first is someone that acts as a subaltern for a Minister, and the other is anyone that runs their own crew of Hands and Associates. Often a given Lieutenant is in fact running their own crew in part to carry out Ministerial duties and in part for their own profit. The respect granted is roughly determined by income in either case. The original formal name for Lieutenant is &quot;Trung Úy&quot;, but a local dialect term is preferred.. </li>
<li><strong>Hand:</strong> An ordinary League member is properly referred to as a &quot;Hand&quot; in English or &quot;Công Nhân&quot; (roughly meaning &quot;worker&quot;) in Vietnamese, although whatever term is common in the local dialect for the bottom rung of organized crime is actually more common. Hands are expected to deliver 20% of the proceeds of their crimes (which in League parlance means pretty much all income) but also receive a cut from the Quartermaster.</li>
<li><strong>Associate:</strong> As in many criminal organizations there is a broad category of people that are not really members or &quot;made men&quot; but are nonetheless critical for its functioning. The League cultivates these Associates carefully and they are considered to roughly be the property and responsibility of whatever Hand or Lieutenant runs them. Luminary monsters spend a shaking out period as an Associate before being made a Hand while Spawn normally remain Associates for life.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="league-status"><a class="header" href="#league-status">League Status</a></h4>
<ol>
<li>Associate: Associate</li>
<li>Member: Hand</li>
<li>Established: Lieutenant or Minor Minister</li>
<li>Powerful: Major Minister or Councilor</li>
<li>Local Leader: Captain or Quartermaster</li>
<li>Senior Leader: Senior Captain or Quartermaster</li>
</ol>
<p>The sixth level of Status in the World Crime League is a little different than the other syndicates in that their senior leadership is exactly the same as their local leadership. In fact with all Syndicates the size of the domain matters a great deal in terms of the influence that local leadership has in the overall organization, but in the World Crime League this is particularly obvious.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h3 id="the-cauchemar-communes"><a class="header" href="#the-cauchemar-communes">The Cauchemar Communes</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;Tradition is but the illusion of permanence. Change is not just inevitable, it is good.&quot;</em></p>
<p><strong>Probably Established:</strong> 18th century CE, Pyrenees Mountains.</p>
<p>Supernatural societies have with necessity been extremely conservative over the generations. And such it was that when the age of enlightenment hit the human world, the supernatural world found itself falling behind. The Cauchemar Communes were founded as a reform movement for the supernatural world to take advantage of the new ideas and opportunities found in human science. The term is French for the common people of the nightmares - which was how non-elder supernatural creatures were thought of in 18th century France. Originally arranged in a &quot;cell structure&quot;, the Communes nominally hold that all of their membership is equal, save for the Revolutionary Committee members themselves who are substantially more equal.</p>
<p>The Cauchemar hold that advancements in human strength and society are, or at least can be, for the good of the supernaturals. Rather than viewing the world as shrinking, leaving them with less and less space in which to hide, the Communes view the world as growing with more and more humans and cities with which to obscure themselves. The Communes' understanding of the Vow of Silence is one based largely upon anonymity rather than invisibility.</p>
<p>As a reformist, &quot;bottom up&quot; movement, the Communes have been able to make great inroads in areas that were previously outside Syndicates, and toppled several minor ones (such as the Puppeteers, the Laibon, and the Kingdom of Yomi). Most impressive of their feats was the dismantling and absorption of the Bumin Horde of Ergenekon. The Cauchemar Communes hold a great deal of power in China and many former Soviet Republics, and also in much of the American Midwest, Canada, and France. The Communes hold territory easily containing more human population than any other Syndicate, a fact that is truly frightening to many other Syndicates considering their newness. Despite their European origins, or perhaps because of the proximity of their founding to the capital of the Covenant, the Communes have made little progress in Western Europe. In 1798 it seemed that the Communes were on the brink of sacking the Heresiarch Council and ending the Covenant Church altogether. However, in the coming years the Covenant made a number of reforms and concessions to various bishops and interest groups and held onto their European holdings all the way to the Alps. The Cauchemar ended up signing onto peace and expanding instead into the lands of those Syndicates that refused to adapt.</p>
<p>The Cauchemar message appeals to the young (which in supernatural terms means those born or made in the last 400 years or so), and campaigns for the removal of traditional privileges for the ancient and established monsters of the world. The Communes favor change and a new way of doing things modeled upon human reforms, but that's about as far as they go in agreeing with one another. It is easy to get the distributed Communes apparatus to help tear down something or turn upon a criminal, but relatively difficult to pass effective resolutions. The ideological divides amongst the Revolutionary Committee are fierce and hard drawn, so the group as a whole acts rarely and with much debate on matters of anything but immediate survival.</p>
<p>It's important to note that of the Syndicates (and for that matter, most Cults) the Communes are the only ones that show much interest in any developments in human political theory in the last 1,000 years. </p>
<h3 id="power-and-office-in-the-cauchemar-communes"><a class="header" href="#power-and-office-in-the-cauchemar-communes">Power and Office in the Cauchemar Communes</a></h3>
<p><em>None of us is as dangerous as all of us.</em></p>
<p>The Cauchemar Communes is at its core a concerted attempt to harness the power of the unruly mob to recreate the most powerful of human institutions encountered by supernatural society: the unruly mob. The Communes value collective action, and disdain hierarchy. But for all their talk of egalitarianism, universality, and brotherhood, the Communes <em>do</em> have a structure. The eternal revolution is not televised, but it <em>is</em> planned. </p>
<p>Communes structure is difficult for outsiders to discern precisely because they eschew titles, ornamentation, and rank. Members of the the Revolutionary Committee are simply called &quot;Citizen [Name]&quot; which is <em>technically</em> the title of <em>every</em> member of the Communes. The only difference is that members who have authority have the title &quot;Citizen&quot; appended to their name every time someone wants to address them, while the appellation is generally informally left off when addressing members of lesser standing. You might think that with no officially acknowledged hierarchy that conflicts over position would be few in number. And you'd be wrong. Jealousy, scheming, and plain old <em>confusion</em> run rampant.</p>
<p>Power is addicting in any society, but in The Communes even more so, because power literally has to be used to be retained. As soon as the mob forgets that they are supposed to follow someone, they'll seriously stop doing it. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Revolutionary Committee:</strong> This group is analogous to the Makhzen's Inner Circle. The Committee meets in various places in Paris, and the only requirement to joining it is the acknowledgment of the other members that the character belongs. Creatures get invited to be temporary members of the committee all the time when they have something important to talk about, and some of these creatures stay on.</li>
<li><strong>The Committee of Public Safety:</strong> Many Cauchemar cities have a Committee of Public Safety, which is a group that gets together to deliberate what is to be done about threats to public order and enforcement of the rules of the Syndicate. Since they can (and occasionally do) decide that what needs to be done is to send Vanguards out to murder someone - essentially trying them in absentia for capital crimes, they can be thought of as a court of law combined with a military planning session.</li>
<li><strong>Committee Seats:</strong> To the extent that the Communes have any other formal operations they are handled by a bewildering array of other committees that nominally report to either the Revolutionary Committee or the local Committee of Public Safety. These vary a great deal between localities, but often include some pretty minor affairs. Chairing your city's Social Committee may not sound like a major coup, but it does mean that you are generally granted the first chance to invite people to events and thus determine who meets with whom. Committees are often quite small and many are composed of the effective minimum of three members. Committees of Finance, Foreign Affairs, Justice, and Public Assistance are common in most domains.</li>
<li><strong>Commissioner:</strong> Anyone that any committee assigns to do something is technically a Commissioner. In practice, it's usually whoever is conscripted to be held responsible for something. It matters a great deal whether your a Commissioner for the Committee of Public Assistance (which largely means getting bitched out by everyone that thinks they should be getting more) or for the Committee for Public Safety, which is practically being a military officer with the authority to kill anyone in the way of getting your mission done.</li>
<li><strong>Demagogue:</strong> Any member of The Communes that others follow is called a &quot;Demagogue&quot; in recognition of that fact. This unofficial rank carries roughly the weight of a Covenant Priest, but if most of the city follows the lead of a member then it's kind of the same as a Makhzen Princeps. One <em>becomes</em> a Demagogue simply by telling other members that they should do something and having them do it. As such, pretty much anyone can claim the title of Demagogue from another by holding a debate about policy and winning decisively. Refusing to debate another is a dangerous path, since a character only retains their Demagogue status by continuing to get members to do stuff. In practice Demagogues can be much more powerful than any formal committee membership would indicate since the Mob will tend to follow them and the committees follow the Mob in turn.</li>
<li><strong>Authority:</strong> Any member of the Communes who is regarded as knowing something and being valuable to consult with on a topic gradually gets the informal title of Authority with the long form being &quot;Authority on XXX&quot; where XXX is whatever members are advised to go ask the character about. The title of Authority is bestowed through acclimation and is achieved through being publicly correct several times. It can be lost by being apparently wrong on something humiliating or important, and if the Authority doesn't pitch in from time to time, other members will gradually forget that they have it - and then they won't anymore.</li>
<li><strong>Vanguard:</strong> Cauchemars who fight bravely and well - or at least <em>apparently</em> impressively successfully - on the behalf of Communes goals are acknowledged as being members of The Vanguard. Rewards for being in the Vanguard are many in that other members will shower them with praise and favors, but Vanguard are also called upon to fight more battles on behalf of the Communes. Senior members of the Vanguard are often chosen as members or Commissioners of the Committees for Public Safety.</li>
<li><strong>Active Citizen:</strong> The basic level of membership in the Communes is to be recognized as a Citizen, but Active Citizenship is the kind that actually matters. Active Citizens are generally entitled attend Communes meetings and to receive public benefits, but are also expected to pay the Contribution, a general tax of 10-20% or if unable to provide a significant monetary Contribution to deliver other services in kind.</li>
<li><strong>Passive Citizens:</strong> Spawn and provisional members of the Communes are technically classified as &quot;Passive Citizens&quot;, meaning that they have no formal rights to participate in Communes politics but do receive the protection of the Communes. Luminary Cauchemar are rapidly promoted to Active Citizen status with the administration of an Oath of Citizenship, while non-Luminaries are never given the privilege.</li>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="cults-1"><a class="header" href="#cults-1">Cults</a></h2>
<p><em>&quot;Has it ever occurred to you that maybe, just maybe, all the crazy pointless crap we do isn't crazy or pointless?&quot;</em></p>
<p>Many magical creatures attempt to increase their magical power by sharing secrets of magic with other supernatural creatures. These mystical filesharing groups serve as secret clubs, religious heresies, and trade guilds. These organizations are semi-secret. While their membership is largely composed of supernatural creatures (whose very existence is a secret from the mundane humans of the world), the specific activities of these groups are kept under wraps even from other supernaturals. </p>
<p>Each Cult is distinguished largely by 3 things. The first is their <strong>Favored Magic</strong>. This is the path of Sorcery that a character can reasonably expect to be taught by joining and advancing within the cult. The second is the <strong>Favored Resources</strong>. These are two resources that a character gets easily whilst a member of the cult in good standing. Further, the character's status within the cult is in some way enhanced by having lots of these backgrounds. And finally there is the <strong>Work</strong>. This is what the cult <em>does</em> in and around supernatural society. For example, the Ulmi family business is finance and bureaucracy, so other supernaturals frequently hire them to navigate human legalities on their behalf. On the flip side, The Black Hand makes it a point to murder people in cold blood, and supernaturals are rarely above hiring <em>them</em> to hammer down nails judged to be standing up.</p>
<p>A note on how to integrate each Cult's work into your chronicle has been included in each Cult's description. Each group has agendas that are in many ways fairly sketchy - and it is not at all inconceivable that the characters may find themselves working with or against any of them. Indeed, it's highly likely that characters will end up teaming up with and opposing the <em>same group</em> at different times.</p>
<h3 id="the-ash-walkers"><a class="header" href="#the-ash-walkers">The Ash Walkers</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;There is nothing that can be seen that cannot be done.&quot;</em></p>
<p>The Ash Walkers were originally founded in the 16th century by a group of Fallen Transhumans as part of the Great Reformation. They viewed, as Jean Calvin did, that the Catholic Church was undergoing a change, and they wanted to reflect everything within the Covenant. Like their mortal church counterparts, they failed to take Rome and ultimately fled to Switzerland and even back into the Dark Reflection. In more recent nights and years, the Covenant has sworn off hunting them to the ends of the Earth and beyond, and they in turn have come back from the ashen wastes and entered into supernatural society. But their time as exiles in Limbo has left its mark on the cult history, methodology, and theology.</p>
<p>The Ash Walkers believe in the doctrine of Total Depravity, which holds that man is incapable of choosing righteousness and even philanthropy (being created by a wicked hand) is evil and thus ultimately pointless. The only people who are capable of being saved from the worlds are those who are predestined to be called out of them. And the ones who are predestined for this honor are by definition the ones who have been chosen to gain magical powers and amass great wealth. The cult thus has developed an extremely mercenary attitude towards all things. Personal gain and the amassing of gold and property are the things that justify everything. The things that demonstrably show that one has been destined for riches and ultimately for salvation since before birth.</p>
<p>True to their Calvinist roots, the Ash Walkers believe in &quot;the deal&quot; above any god. Lying, cheating, and stealing are all fine, but actual contracts and ownership are the basis for wealth. And screwing with <em>that</em> would undermine the entire foundation of their ethos.</p>
<p><strong>Missions for the Ash Walkers:</strong> The Ash Walkers want only one thing: cold hard cash. However, the things that pass for currency in different places are themselves numerous. The Ash Walkers will cut the team in on pretty much any deal as long as it makes a profit, whether that's a profit in gold or a profit in kittens. Let your imagination run wild, because Ash Walkers see opportunities in places that others see only an endless funnel of madness.</p>
<p><strong>Sample Adventure:</strong> An Ash Walker has invested in some land where it was cheap - in Mongolia, and intends to have the natives mine gold for him. Unfortunately, Mongolian Werewolves have other ideas and are taking over for some reason. Anxious to not lose the investment, he's offering a bounty to the player characters to clean up the problem.</p>
<p><strong>The Ash Walkers as Antagonists:</strong> Money may not be the root of all evil, and not everything that religion touches turns to ash. But the Ash Walkers <em>do</em> essentially worship money, and they <em>do</em> have a whole thing about turning things to ash. And that pretty much means that any villainy you can imagine someone might perpetuate for personal profit or religious zeal is one that the Ash Walkers are all over. These guys can seriously be the villains from any 80s cartoon show.</p>

<h3 id="the-black-hand"><a class="header" href="#the-black-hand">The Black Hand</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;A well placed knife can change the world.&quot;</em></p>
<p>The most famous thing that the Black Hand ever did was assassinate Archduke Ferdinand. But of course, they have killed a <em>lot</em> of people. The Black Hand kill people. Sometimes it's for money, sometimes it's for political gain, but <em>mostly</em> it's to increase the chaos and strife in the world. At least, officially. The Black Hand preaches that without war and conflict between mortal nations the supernatural creatures cannot survive. Thus they reason that war should be encouraged between humans lest the last hiding place for the supernatural fade from the Earth. Of course, humans don't actually seem to <em>need</em> any encouragement to murder one another, and honestly neither do supernatural creatures. And The Black Hand is more than happy to take a donation in order to end the life of someone powerful.</p>
<p>While the Black Hand has surfaced numerous times, supporting numerous political agendas, and many individual members of the Black Hand are indeed personally committed to one or more of these causes, the organization as a whole supports fanaticism generally. Having or feigning a strong religious or political agenda for which you are ready and eager to kill is a good way to move up in the Black Hand. Indeed, it's basically the <em>only</em> way to get promoted. The heads of the Black Hand are the Seven Master Killers, and supposedly they all got that position by murdering one of the previous heads. Several of the Master Killers are Nosferatu, and it is rumored that the ones they killed were their own sires. They don't seem to much judge the relative worth of ideologies, holding firmly to a relativist stance that <em>certainty</em> is the one measurable virtue. </p>
<p><strong>Missions for the Black Hand:</strong> It's not <em>just</em> &quot;assassinate this dude&quot;, sometimes Black Handers are paid to <em>protect</em> someone from potential assassination. If they need to call in to their friends for additional assistance, then so be it.</p>
<p><strong>Sample Adventure:</strong> There is tension between ethnically Spanish and Mayan people in Guatemala all the time. But there is also a set of credulous investigators there that are endangering the Vow of Silence. The Black Hand wants you to pick a side, get some shit started, and have the investigators disappear in the ensuing strife.</p>
<p><strong>The Black Hand as Antagonists:</strong> Some of our favorite people haven't been killed yet. And if the Black Hand has anything to say about it, that will change soon. The Black Hand's pro-murder agenda can easily pit them against anyone who hasn't been murdered yet or who has friends or loved ones that have yet to be murdered.</p>

<h3 id="church-of-set"><a class="header" href="#church-of-set">Church of Set</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;Look like the innocent flower; But be the serpent under it.&quot;</em></p>
<p>The Church of Set is a den of iniquity attached to a slanderous body of vile drug dealers and whore mongers. And they wouldn't have it any other way. It's a religious organization in a sense, but their core tenet is that the dissolution of the moral compass that drives people is a necessary and positive development. They stand for unabashed hedonism and personal empowerment through the actualization of the rejection of hindering moral frameworks and their replacement with goal oriented perfection.</p>
<p>Corruption is a way of life amongst the Church of Set. Not just for themselves, but for everyone around them that they can convince to partake. The Church of Set has pretty shaky views on what is right and wrong, but they strongly view that getting people to do things that those people believe are wrong is right. It all has something to do with confronting memes and taboos that are holding you back in life. The members of the Church of Set are called Setites, and each Setite is supposed to create for themselves a life path and framework of taboos that advance their own goals. It's all rather similar to Nietzsche and looks more than a bit like Leveyan Satanism. You're supposed to <em>become</em> an Übermensch, and you achieve that by doing things that you and the people around you think are so wrong that you wouldn't do them.</p>
<p>And then of course, there's the obligatory ancient Egyptian motifs that they put all over things. It was the 1800s, and it was the style of the time. Setite lore holds that the church existed thousands of years ago and was only <em>rediscovered</em> in the 1800s, which is pretty much what the Rosicrucians and all the other 19th century occult groups would have you believe. Be that as it may, Setites hold that their first leader was actually Set - the Egyptian god who killed Horus every evening and was in turn slain by Horus every morning. Still, it is perhaps telling that many of their theological points appear to share more with the Setites written about in Robert E. Howard's books of the early 20th century than they do with the Cult of Set of Upper Egypt's Naqadan people.</p>
<p><strong>Missions for the Church of Set:</strong> The Setites collect vices like trading cards, and do everything in their power to encourage their spreading and to facilitate their use. Setites run drugs, pimp prostitutes, wear indecent clothing and deface religious texts. And they want your help. They want your help protecting people from reprisals against obscene behavior, they want your help in convincing people to corrupt themselves. And they want your help in doing things that push your own moral limits.</p>
<p><strong>Sample Adventure:</strong> Pods have taken over the children of a small farming town out in Kansas. They've taken to using the children to capture people and sacrifice them to grow more pods or towards the creation of a permanent gateway to Maya. The Setites want the team to wipe out the Pods, taking care to leave none of the collaborators living and free. Of course, many of the collaborators are only six...</p>
<p><strong>The Church of Set as Antagonists:</strong> Setites do things that they think are wrong and try to get other people to do things that they think are wrong as well. And while it is philosophically interesting to strive for a world of &quot;No Taboos, Only Goals&quot; the fact remains that they are still going out of their way to cross other peoples' limits of acceptance. If there is something that you won't accept, chances are some Setite is out there right now <em>doing</em> it.</p>

<h3 id="chain-of-coronis"><a class="header" href="#chain-of-coronis">Chain of Coronis</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;An it harm none, do as you will&quot;</em></p>
<p>The Chain of Coronis is an anarchist pagan sect dedicated to the study of cutting the life force out of people and using it to power larger magics to cut the life blood out of more people. They don't like modern religions, modern society, modern government, or modern technology. They espouse an ideology in which life would be better if we all spent more time ripping the necks out of goats with our teeth. Also, they run around naked in the woods and seriously rip the throats out of goats with their teeth.</p>
<p>An inductee into the Chain of Coronis is called a <em>Maenad</em>, and they are encouraged to act like their ancient Greek namesake as often as possible. Running around naked in the dark is demanded during various solar and lunar events, but is encouraged at all times. Of special note is that they at no time speak of modernity as being a &quot;tool of oppression&quot; or anything along those lines. Indeed, you can pretty much ignore any political speeches you have ever heard from any vegan modern-wiccan you have ever met. The Chain objects to modernity on a priori grounds. The state of &quot;Nature&quot; is deemed to be <em>inherently</em> morally superior to a world defined by artifice. They do not recognize the &quot;Social Contract&quot; upon which many modern political philosophies are based, having instead a set of twin ideals of &quot;natural law&quot; and &quot;personal excellence&quot; that would make more sense to Aristotle or Manu than to Hobbes or Rousseau.</p>
<p>The Chain looks at the world as being in its natural state ordered into many different &quot;chains&quot; that correspond to maturity levels. Higher, more mature chains are supposed to be able to push around lesser chains. But they are also supposed to lead by example - showing the younger and more foolish chains their inherent and learned virtues. By this rubric, supernatural creatures (even young ones) are &quot;more mature&quot; than humans (even old humans). Similarly, humans are more mature than goats. And of course, the creatures in the chain founded by Coronis the Maenad are more mature than unaffiliated supernatural creatures.</p>
<p><strong>Missions for the Chain of Coronis:</strong> It's not all hippie eco-terrorism and blood sacrifices. It's also listening to Godsmack and having orgies in the woods. And a vast amount of extremely serious politicking. The Chain is not anti-authority, but they are opposed to all the current forms of government (both mortal and supernatural). This does <em>not</em> mean that they sit around in squalid tenements and whine about &quot;The Man&quot; but rather that they play the game as adeptly as anyone - just always for the opposition (for the moment). They spurn mortal currency, but they are well able to trade favors and magic for the gathering of blackmail material, the fomenting of discord, the manufacture of crises, or anything else that may be able to advance their agenda. They think long term. The Industrial Era, after all, is just a phase.</p>
<p><strong>Sample Adventure:</strong> A Prince of the Makhzen has died, and foul play is indeed the cause. The new Prince wants it all covered up and forgotten, but the Chain does not. The characters are instructed to dig as deep as they can and make sure that the guilty are justly and officially punished. This sudden interest in enforcement of regulations surprises Makhzen members familiar with Coronist ideology, but given the damage these truths can cause, it really shouldn't.</p>
<p><strong>The Chain as Antagonists:</strong> No matter what any old timer or even your own nostalgia tells you, many of the &quot;old ways&quot; were in fact abandoned because they were deemed substantially worse than the ways that came to replace them. <em>Many</em> of the things that the Chain (or at least various members of it) want to roll back are actually pretty cool. Pants for example. But also modern systems of government and diplomatic compromises. There is a lot wrong with them, but they replaced the old ways <em>for a reason</em>. While the Chain members think of themselves as working to reclaim a lost glory, they can often come off as brutal reactionaries.</p>

<h3 id="the-order-daziban"><a class="header" href="#the-order-daziban">The Order Daziban</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;The greater the loyalty toward the group, the greater is the motivation among the members to achieve the goals of the group, and the greater the probability that the group will achieve its goals.&quot;</em></p>
<p>The Order Daziban is a sorcerous cabal of dubious goals and shadowy methods. The Daziban were founded by Baali Witches with a penchant for burning things, so it is ironic that what they currently do is collect books. They collect other things too: rare butterflies, magic artifacts, secret information, and frankly who knows what all else. But they are most known for their collections of books.</p>
<p>The Daziban are secretive and very disciplined. They are the cult most likely to regard loyalty to the cult to be more important than loyalty to the band. They are organized into autocratic fiefdoms called &quot;vaults&quot; and the lord and master of each one is given a fancy title that basically means &quot;librarian&quot; (yes, including &quot;codicier&quot; for W40k players). They can be called upon for archival information, and often are, simply because they keep so much of it around.</p>
<p>The Order Daziban puts a great deal of stock in status, and has at least 40 distinct ranks that members can be at. However, from a game mechanical standpoint, the basic numerical status ranks work fine. Technically a Lexicanium is a different rank from Keeper of Scrolls, but practically speaking both are the leaders of their respective vaults and whoever's input is most relevant to a particular course of action will be the one that is listened to. Rising up in rank in the Daziban is a complicated proposition that involves a whole lot of gaining seniority with a significant dose of brown nosing and accomplishment thrown into the mix. The Order is essentially a guild in the medieval sense, and their advancement rules are baroque.</p>
<p><strong>Missions for the Daziban:</strong> The Daziban will frequently send a team out for basic fetch quests such as &quot;retrieve rare book X&quot; or even &quot;destroy rare book X&quot; when the vault already has one of the other copies. Some of their missions are more opaque, and generally involve thwarting the plans of various Ifrit with whom they have some unspoken yet long standing grudge.</p>
<p><strong>Sample Adventure:</strong> Eager to appear more powerful and knowledgeable than he perhaps actually is, the vault archivist let on that he knew something about a Sumerian compound used by the Shattered Empire that he in fact has no idea about. With his bluff called by someone wishing to <em>purchase</em> his information, he wants one of the underlings to take his most trusted associates to do some snooping by the Euphrates on the down-low.</p>
<p><strong>The Daziban as Antagonists:</strong> The Daziban like to be the only ones who know things. This means that if the player characters gain access to special information, they can easily create enemies for themselves in the Daziban organization. But they also like power and stealing stuff, so it's easy to see the players being political or law enforcement opponents of the local Daziban vault as well.</p>

<h3 id="the-false-face"><a class="header" href="#the-false-face">The False Face</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;The world has become tired.&quot;</em></p>
<p>The False Face used to be essentially a Syndicate, as it was <em>the</em> supernatural social group north of the Rio Grande. It very much lost an extremely bloody inter-Syndicate war with The Covenant, and now it hangs on as a minor cult that many don't even realize still exists. This event is actually one of the reasons that Syndicates are on such elaborately polite terms with each other tonight. It was indeed quite a shock to the largely isolationist supernatural creatures to see <em>how much</em> damage a group of supernatural creatures backed up by a bunch of human conquistadors could do, and diplomacy has been the name of the game ever since - not that this has done any good for the False Face itself.</p>
<p>The False Face itself is a shamanic lodge based largely on Iroquois social and magical foundations. Their members traditionally wear masks during important procedures, and their leadership are called &quot;The Empty Ones&quot;. At one time they did some of everything in the way Syndicates do now, but these nights they focus on exploring things. Mostly they go on long dream walks in Maya, looking for something that they don't tell anyone about. But they also explore other strange places. Supernatural creatures will often purchase their services in exploring things they want looked into or buy maps and information about secret places from them.</p>
<p>Most of The Empty Ones are Camazotz, although it is not at all obvious whether this is a result of the lodge having always been run by Daeva or a simple result of the fact that it is very difficult to kill vampires in any permanent fashion. In any case, while some of them entertain fantasies of retaking North America, most of them are committed to the new path of exploring and ultimately moving to the Dreamlands. What happens afterwards is still being debated in the lodge.</p>
<p><strong>Missions for the False Face:</strong> The False Face not only does a lot of their own scouting missions, but also takes mercenary scouting missions for others. Many of these missions are in the Dreamlands, but they can be anywhere. In addition, as the False Face moves more and more into the Dreamlands, they are finding themselves coming to blows with various factions of Evil Plants and the Marduk Society. And of course, there are a number of Giant Animals that need to be hunted before various areas become usable.</p>
<p><strong>Sample Adventure:</strong> A family of Deep One kin in Massachusetts has recently uncovered a connection between their family plot and a set of underwater caverns. They'd really like to know what all was going on with their grandparent's diaries and Polynesian statues. The players are brought in to solve these mysteries and make sure that the family does not break the Vow of Silence, either by withholding important information or making sure the family understands the importance of keeping what information they know secret - or some combination. It's really up to them.</p>
<p><strong>The False Face as Antagonists:</strong> There are seriously Empty Ones who openly call for the purging of one or more Syndicates (mostly the Covenant, but some of them are not picky). So it's entirely reasonable for the False Face to send one or more of its members to outright murder the player characters or someone they care about &quot;to make a point&quot;. Also, some of the stuff they want for the big migration is stuff that people in the mortal world <em>own</em> or at least would prefer to remain where it is.</p>

<h3 id="the-hashshashin"><a class="header" href="#the-hashshashin">The Hashshashin</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;All of heaven awaits.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Begun in Arabia by a group of Troglodytes as a drug addled death cult, the Hashshashin are... still a drug addled death cult. Their leaders are called Imams, and they have a truly confusing theology involving darkening senses to achieve paradise, but basically they smuggle people and drugs, consume lots of drugs (and not a few people), and generally behave in a manner that almost every religion will tell you is &quot;very very bad&quot;. Not all, or even most, of the members of the cult are supernatural - but the mortals are treated to a virtually continuous orgy of narcotics and debauchery and probably couldn't explain anything about the compounds upon leaving anyway.</p>
<p>Whether shipping kilos of heroin or trucks full of Moldovans, a lot of money passes through their hands - that stuff seriously isn't cheap. But at least seemingly they don't give a crap about the money and do the crime <em>in order for there to be more crime</em>. This is only partially true, because the real reason that they get their members to commit acts generally considered to be reprehensible is to enhance their loyalty and lessen their attachment to their own lives.</p>
<p>Periodically, members of the cult that have grown indolent in their depravity and ceased being coherent or useful are dragged off into the nether reaches of the cult compounds and devoured. This is inflicted primarily upon the human members of the cult. Remember those completely pointless cages full of people who no longer cared where they woke up in the morning from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070034/">Enter the Dragon</a>? The Hashshashin <em>actually have those</em>. The members who ask about the missing are given extra rations of drugs and told in all seriousness that the victims were &quot;consumed entirely by their vices&quot;. </p>
<p><strong>Missions for the Hashshashin:</strong> The Hashshashin sponsor all kinds of actually pretty marginal criminal enterprises in order to &quot;keep their claws in&quot;. Shipping weapons, drugs, and people around Eastern Europe, Northern Africa, and Central Asia isn't glamorous, but it is <em>constant</em>. Unbelievable amounts of feathers on every side get ruffled by this sort of behavior, and the Hashshashin like it that way. And hey, in areas of total corruption and lawlessness, there are some very large paychecks to be had along the way. Hashshashin leadership won't even mind.</p>
<p><strong>Sample Adventure:</strong> A mysterious Romanian crime boss wants to take out one of his Bulgarian counterparts, and has hired the Hashshashin to do it. The Hashshashin didn't even bother negotiating the price, because they are doing it in order to collect blackmail materials on the Romanian businessman. The players find themselves being asked to double cross multiple people and bearing the brunt of unfocused wrath from several disappointed business groups.</p>
<p><strong>The Hashshashin as Antagonists:</strong> Hashshashin inductions are the result of kidnappings as often as not, so it is extremely possible that one or more people that the player characters care about could be kidnapped by the Hashshashin for the purposes of drugging them up to subsequently train as an assassin, whore them out, or simply eat them. And then of course there's the whole &quot;morality&quot; angle in which player characters may object to slave trading, supporting African warlords, or who knows what all else. Hashshashin compounds can make for very effective dungeon crawls.</p>

<h3 id="the-hollow-ones"><a class="header" href="#the-hollow-ones">The Hollow Ones</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;Misery loves company. The company loves misery.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Formed as a single corporation called &quot;Monolith Corporation&quot; in the latter years of the Victorian Era in England, The Hollow Ones are now a series of corporations so complex in structure and interdependencies that even members of the group are unlikely to be able to follow it all. The original stated goal from the founding Icarid was to use the corporation's inherent structure to limit culpability for his own actions, something that he was apparently quite obsessed with. The current reason for The Hollow Ones is much the same. Their corporate charters allow each choice made to be made collectively and secretly without any specific blame to be placed on the honor of any specific supernatural member.</p>
<p>The Hollow Ones are extremely fond of maintaining the <em>apparent</em> integrity of each member of the cult. They also sponsor vices and depravity sessions for supernatural creatures and wealthy human clients alike. Each member is expected to maintain at least two lives: one for engaging in respectability and one for being a crazy whore-mongering deviant. The Hollow Ones expect themselves to travel about within human society and to play by society's rules, and to <em>totally freak out</em> on a regular basis under controlled and deniable circumstances in order to keep themselves from losing control in front of other people.</p>
<p><strong>Missions for the Hollow Ones:</strong> As a major international corporation, The Monolith Corporation has a number of needs that are essentially spy thriller boiler plate. They want prototypes stolen, they want officials intimidated or bribed, they want dossiers recovered or destroyed, and so on and so forth. But they also have their shadow operations, where they want their sex dungeons kept under wraps, they want reporters intimidated or bribed, and so on and so forth.</p>
<p><strong>Sample Adventure:</strong> One of the clients has gone on quite a bender, and has left a lot of evidence and destruction in the wake of his rampage. The team gets sent to clean things up, MIB style. Remember that this sort of behavior is regarded ambivalently by the Syndicates. Covering up a Vow of Silence breach is the greatest commitment to the First Code of the World Crime League, but protecting a code breaker is pissing all over the Fourth.</p>
<p><strong>The Hollow Ones as Antagonists:</strong> Anyone who has spent any amount of time watching <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098763/">Captain Planet</a> can probably think of like a dozen plots involving evil corporations as the villains. Don't go that far. The Hollow Ones are not the villains from <em>Captain Planet</em>, they are Dr. Jekyll in charge of the corporation from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078748/">Alien</a> (the Weyland-Yutani corporation, by the way). Still, if the schemes of a deliberately amoral corporation aren't enough to call for an occasional thwarting, they'll just have to buy some new ones that are.</p>

<p>The Laughter Factory, sometimes called simply The Factory is an anarchistic organization dedicated to information freedom, compromise, and the propagation of mutual understanding. Also they are a distributed subversive element that appears to be advancing an unknown agenda whose true nature is known only in parts by individual cells. That's not just hyperbole or conspiracy theorizing, The Factory's official stance is that it is working towards something called &quot;The Agenda&quot; and that individual members only know small fragments of it, and some of the things about The Agenda that they know are things they don't <em>know</em> that they know because they are hidden as riddles or parts of other messages. The inherent contradiction of having a secret agenda of information sharing is not lost on the members of The Factory, and when questioned about it, they frequently demure and pronounce it to be funny.</p>
<p>The Laughter Factory is the closest of any of the major cults to one that is exclusive to a specific group of supernaturals. Almost all leading members of the Factory are Mi Go. There are officially speaking only two ranks to be had in the Factory: a <em>Foreman</em> and a <em>Worker</em>. Supernatural creatures rapidly rise to the rank of Foreman. From there on, Foremen are judged by their trustworthiness and mission success rate, but they have no officially sanctioned authority. The organization also has many human members drawn from the muttering dregs of society's castoffs. These humans rarely rise above the rank of Worker and are used much as Makhzen retainers are. What truths these human Workers receive are so shrouded in falsehoods and babble that The Factory has so far been able to claim themselves as being essentially exempt from Vow of Silence investigations on this point.</p>
<p>The Laughter Factory was created in the mid 19th century by Mi Go who wanted to change the relationship between Leviathans and Tiamat in the same way that humans had changed their relationship to capital and trade. In doing so they destroyed the previous Mi Go cult known as &quot;The Solemn Hive&quot;, led by the Gray Queen (who was apparently killed in 1874). The organization is similar, save primarily for an apparent lack of a Queen figure and the purposeful replacement of the rank of &quot;soldier&quot; with the more industrial-age friendly title of &quot;Foreman&quot;. In marked contrast to the Hive, Factory Workers are expected to produce jokes and parties, and similar emotional fetters to tie people together. Producing social ties and global connectivity on an industrial scale. For the Agenda. Whatever that is.</p>
<p><strong>Missions for the Factory:</strong> The Factory actually <em>specializes</em> in the Courier Run, so the mission of &quot;take X to Y&quot; is pretty much assumed. But beyond that, they are often employed to be the bearers of bad news or impartial mediators in tense discussions.</p>
<p><strong>Sample Adventure:</strong> Different Communes factions have taken sides in the ongoing Sri Lankan civil war. Now that it is winding down and the Singalese government is putting the Tamil minorities into camps, a set of neutral outsiders is being asked to negotiate the release of the Tamil Bagheera to prevent the incident from spreading to other regions under Cauchemar control. And because of your Factory connections, the neutral outsiders are the player characters.</p>
<p><strong>The Laughter Factory as Antagonists:</strong> Information freedom is basically just another word for spying, and promoting understanding is pretty much the same thing as telling secrets to other interested parties. People with things to hide may well find themselves opposed by Factory members. Then again, there are some theories, even within the Factory itself, that The Agenda is a very bad thing, and if even some of those theories are true the player characters may be opposed on those grounds.</p>

<h3 id="rolnicy"><a class="header" href="#rolnicy">Rolnicy</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;All animals are equal. Some are more equal and others less.&quot;</em></p>
<p>The Rolnicy were originally a sect of Central Asian warrior shamans, but they have since turned on &quot;superstition&quot; and adapted the trappings of modernity and reason in their fiercely hierarchical and monolithic fashion. Adapting to the times, the Rolnicy gave up their shamanistic beliefs in the 1800s for the teachings of the Eastern Orthodoxy, and in the early 1900s gave those up as well for an uncompromising materialism. With each shift has come murders and purges, but while the doctrines have changed beyond ready recognition, <em>adherence</em> to the doctrine of the hour has always been held of paramount importance.</p>
<p>Today the Rolnicy have greatest affinity with the Cauchemar Communes, and have a similar structure, with their own Revolutionary Council (which used to be called the Ecclesiastical Council before it was liquidated and replaced). It has been suggested, even by the Rolnicy themselves, that they would like to replace the Communes Revolutionary Council with their own. Below that, pretty much everyone is designated a Commissar or a Worker. Commissariats are all nominally in charge of something, which is either Enlightenment, Loyalty, or History. Commissars of Loyalty are like judges who also do investigations - like a Makhzen Sheriff. Commissars of Enlightenment are in charge of research, and Commissars of History are in charge of explaining what has happened and what the Rolnicy doctrines have always been to the Workers (especially when these things change on the orders of the Council). All Commissariats have dispensation from the Cult to kill in order to complete any of their tasks (although this is not recognized by the World Crime League, Makhzen, Communes, or Covenant).</p>
<p>The Rolnicy have codified their ancient shamanistic animal magic practices into a forward looking pseudo-science of animal magic. They also have a complex racial hierarchy system that forms a theoretical basis for why Call of the Wild works on the creatures it does and how. Further, they do a large amount of destructive testing on animals, people, and even supernatural creatures in order to attempt to gain more information to validate their theories. Rolnicy compounds are a lot like farms, in that they grow animals of various sorts in large numbers, and most of them are ultimately going to be eaten.</p>
<p>The Rolnicy want what is &quot;best&quot; although best <em>for whom</em> is a question that is somewhat up in the air. Rolnicy orthodoxy disdains the value of the individual, and is explicitly willing to sacrifice members of its own group to further its aims. The protocols call for modernization, but their own work looks like a biological nightmare from a 1950s science fiction movie. Still, their ruthless methodologies <em>have</em> produced results, and their faction may have the only creatures from Earth to know what the little wibbly things inside the Pods <em>do</em>. They are also always in need of fresh meat for their experiments, meaning that they are a useful method of disposing of bodies - something that all Syndicates have called on them to do.</p>
<p><strong>Missions for the Rolnicy:</strong> The Rolnicy are desperately afraid that they will somehow fall behind in their research, and are constantly attempting to spy on other magical researchers. Also, they are attempting to take over the Communes. But beyond all that, they really do need a lot of weird animals and people for their research. And their research really does turn up some fucking scary information about Evil Plants sometimes. This makes a good springboard for basic intrigue, kidnappings, and even the occasional &quot;save the world&quot; quest.</p>
<p><strong>Sample Adventure:</strong> After a series of disappearances, the press starts raising a stink. And that generates a stink in the halls of the Makhzen. As blame and aspersions start running wild, a Rolnicy Commissariat suggests that perhaps no members of the Syndicate are responsible, and requests aid in tracking down a Chimera in order to prove it. But is there just one Chimera on the loose? On which word does the emphasis fall in the previous sentence?</p>
<p><strong>The Rolnicy as Antagonists:</strong> These guys are basically Bolsheviks who do unethical medical research and commit crimes. You've got Boris and Natasha working for Brick Top and Dr. Moreau. I am <em>confident</em> that you can find something to work in as a possible antagonist.</p>

<h3 id="sisterhood-of-the-wolf-mother"><a class="header" href="#sisterhood-of-the-wolf-mother">Sisterhood of the Wolf-Mother</a></h3>
<p>The Sisterhood of the Wolf-Mother is all that is left of what was once the most terrifying Syndicate in the world. The Bumin Horde of Ergenekon was lead by the Wolf-Mother Asena and her hand-chosen Wolf Khans. The Horde was the closest anything has ever come to that bogey-man of the night: an army of Werewolves. Asena herself was rumored to have an Elder power or sorcerous ritual that could produce Werewolves without the near-death experience and had forged a hidden empire out of the peoples and monsters of the steppe. When her eye turned to Europe the Covenant and Makhzen thought it was only a slight delay before she came for them. Instead, the Communes utterly shattered the Horde's hierarchy through the simple expedient of offering her subjects a voice in their own rule. Asena and her Khans were (quite literally) devoured by the children she had herself created.</p>
<p>And so the Communes came to have a (much smaller) army of Werewolves ready for action and this played significantly into their position at the negotiating table with the other Syndicates. While what was left of the magical lore of Ergenekon eventually became part of Rolnicy, among the young Cauchemar Communes the remains of the Cult of Asena became the Sisterhood of the Wolf-Mother. Commonly (but not within their range of hearing) compared to Amazons, the Sisterhood has become an independent supernatural mercenary company. They are distributed largely throughout Communes territory, but they work for the highest bidder.</p>
<p>While the original members of the Sisterhood of the Wolf-Mother were indeed all female Werewolves, their membership criteria have relaxed considerably in the last two hundred years, although the majority of their membership still identify as women, or at least as having some kind of relationship to femininity for those that are substantially non-human. The ritual of initiation hasn't changed much from when they ritually murdered candidates to spread Lycanthropy to them, but now they let you join even if you're already a monster and won't be transformed.</p>
<p><strong>Missions for the Sisterhood of the Wolf-Mother:</strong> While they're mostly hired for bug hunts in locations where going loud isn't going to endanger the Vow of Silence, the Sisterhood also gets called out for lower-key special operations assignments or to defend targets, and they aren't above farming out the less-fun jobs.</p>
<p><strong>Sample Adventure:</strong> A minister of the Shattered Empire is trying to wake up a lesser known Terracotta Army. <em>Again</em>. Whatever Syndicate is closest to the site has ordered that everyone involved be terminated with extreme prejudice. Once you're up-country you can turn into wolves, summon demons, call aerial bombardment, whatever. Kill or silence anyone that gets in the way or sees you doing it; we're trying to <em>send a message</em>.</p>
<p><strong>The Sisterhood of the Wolf-Mother as Antagonists:</strong> While the Sisterhood is usually pretty careful to stay on the down-low until they're allowed off the leash (which is another thing you should definitely not say within earshot of them) they are notably less enthusiastic about the clean-up than they are the killing. They're not particularly easy to work with and also have a cavalier attitude about whether recruits survive initiation, so they have a lot of enemies that would like to have them taken down a peg but wouldn't dare confront them openly.</p>

<h3 id="stellar-oracles"><a class="header" href="#stellar-oracles">Stellar Oracles</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;Heaven may forgive you, but I will not!&quot;</em></p>
<p>The Stellar Oracles were begun by a group of reincarnated warriors who have been fighting the King with Three Shadows for many lifetimes with mixed success. They are a warrior order that has been completely wiped out several times in history, and yet been able to bring itself back to existence like a blazing phoenix as new lifetimes of old members come again as the wheel of seasons and years rolls inexorably on. The Stellar Oracles are the holders of a number of prophecies, only a few of which are outsiders allowed to see. They have a rather complicated dogma involving the effects of the planets on the future, but they seriously do have a number of members with Divination and they really do know a fair amount about future events.</p>
<p>Stellar Oracles see themselves not as humanity’s masters, but as their protectors. And they see the greatest threats to humanity as coming from otherworldly sources. Death in the service of the cause is for many considered to be not so much a risk of the job but an inevitability of sacred duty. And indeed, death <em>is</em> something of a revolving door for many members. It's fairly difficult to rise to become royalty amongst the Stellar Oracles without having died for the cause at least once.</p>
<p><strong>Missions for the Stellar Oracles:</strong> Stellar Oracle leadership generally wants to do one of three things: destroy &quot;monsters&quot;, protect humans, or collect old members who have returned to life and induct them into the cult once more. As such, there is a fair amount of straight up crime fighting that Stellar Oracles are called upon to do, but there can also be quite complex interactions with Vampires or Reborn.</p>
<p><strong>Sample Adventure:</strong> Somewhere in the city an Asura has come through from the Dark Reflection and is repeatedly draining energy out of mortals in order to bring Mirror Goblins across like some grim parody of a work visa program. The Oracle is sent to assemble their band, track down the Asura and kick Limbo ass before the army of Mirror Goblins gets too large to defend the city against while maintaining secrecy.</p>
<p><strong>Stellar Oracles as Antagonists:</strong> Unlike most groups of supernaturals, the Stellar Oracles explicitly side with humans over their fellow supernaturals. So while their official doctrine is one of secrecy, it is very easy to imagine a Stellar Oracle zealot deciding to try to skull fuck the Vow of Silence. Of less Earth shattering and more personal opposition, a Stellar Oracle could decide (correctly or not) that one or more of the player characters is responsible for some crime against humanity or another, leading to direct and intimate conflict.</p>

<h3 id="the-storm-lords"><a class="header" href="#the-storm-lords">The Storm Lords</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;A small rock holds back a great wave.&quot;</em></p>
<p>After the fall of Tiamat, the Leviathans of the world found themselves hunted throughout every land on Earth. Some for vengeance, but increasingly for the fact that their flesh could make a man immortal. And it was in this environment that a group of Deep Ones removed themselves from the land altogether. The thought was that they could rule tiny undersea kingdoms in peace and quiet, never to be molested by Marduk's hunters on the land. This experiment was mostly a failure.</p>
<p>As it happens, Leviathans aren't many in number, and they need to crossbreed with normal humans or their blood stagnates and stillbirths become the norm. The colony at the Pacific Pole of Inaccessibility and the colony in the Antarctic waters both died out to a man, leaving nothing but empty creepy architecture beneath the waves. And while the Polynesian, New England, and Mediterranean colonies persisted, they did so only by regularly sending their people above the waves to have families in human settlements. And those children were born without gills, gaining them only later in life. Which meant that they were again vulnerable to predation on the surface.</p>
<p>With the coming of the Age of Reason, the undersea colonies came under an even more direct threat: exposure by the baleful glare of the light of reason. Once the sea floor started being mapped, it became clear to even the most conservative colonists that the age of being able to successfully withdraw from the world was rapidly drawing to an end. And so a council was formed, and it was decided to begin a new age of engagement with humanity. And the ones to do it were named Storm Lords.</p>
<p>The Storm Lords immediately went to work aping the trappings of science. After all, the only way to keep a human from discovering their hideouts was to <em>be</em> the human explorers who came back with enough information from exploring them to quench the curiosity of the land dwellers and send other would-be explorers to other corners of the globe. And it was not long before new generations of Storm Lords actually <em>were</em> scientists. These nights there are Storm Lords working in fields from news to meteorology - each giving out reports that give plausible cover for supernatural goings-on.</p>
<p>At the bottom of it all is the &quot;Special Project&quot;, which is a longterm goal of adding things to scientific fields that make room for supernatural creatures and powers. And hand-in-fin with that is the goal of popularizing ideas that make this future more acceptable to the lay public. Comic books, science detectives, and cartoon shows have all been penned by Storm Lords in a deliberate attempt to make people accept the &quot;far out&quot; direction they intend to guide scientific research in the generations to come. If the Storm Lords have their way, we will soon all be living in the future from Johnny Quest.</p>
<p><strong>Missions for the Storm Lords:</strong> Missions from Storm Lords typically involve taking out a Marduk operation, recruiting supernaturals with weather changing skills, or covering up one of the other two. The Marduk Society's future is completely incompatible with the one envisioned by the Storm Lords, a fact that <em>might</em> be related to the fact that they've been at war with the Marduk Society since before they even decided to start making a human future of their own. But there is also a lot of scientific research to destroy and/or fabricate. The future is a big place.</p>
<p><strong>Sample Adventure:</strong> The Marduks have set up shop on a tropical island, with the intent of attacking the nearby Storm Lord hideout and capturing everyone there for &quot;research&quot; by the higher ups. The Storm Lords don't want this to happen and are going to have their agent and his team take out the base and then cover up the fact that there was ever a base to take out.</p>
<p><strong>The Storm Lords as Antagonists:</strong> The Storm Lords are playing a <em>big</em> game and they are not afraid to lose pieces. Their future plans involve many things that exist today simply not being there any more. Some things because the future system simply has no room for them, and others because sacrifices simply have to be made. But even if the player characters have not been tagged as expendable, there's the simple fact that in the long run the Storm Lords intend to replace the Vow of Silence with a system of supernatural tolerance. That doesn't go over really well with a lot of denizens of the night, who would be forced to abandon the safety of the shadows without even being offered the mantle of kingship.</p>

<h3 id="the-ulmians"><a class="header" href="#the-ulmians">The Ulmians</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;Loyalty to the family. To death and beyond.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Originally a family of Venetians who turned to dark magic, the Ulmi family became a criminal mob amongst the supernaturals, adding to their ranks a great number of unrelated supernaturals who wanted in on their necromantic protection rackets. Never achieving the wealth or strength of the World Crime League in impoverished and superstitious Europe, the Ulmians never achieved Syndicate status. Upon running into the WCL, they found themselves badly outnumbered in the world of supernatural crime and largely caved in to pressure from the East. The Ulmi <em>mostly</em> went legit and now provide gray market financial services and money laundering to supernaturals with little or no presence in the human world.</p>
<p>The Ulmians are still operated like a mafia family, and they still do a lot of criminal activities. It's just that now they make sure to avoid strongarming other supernaturals - at least without WCL permission. While it is now common for an Ulmi Don to be something other than an Italian Khaibit related by blood to the founders, it is still incredibly rare for anyone without necromantic power to rise to any meaningful level in the organization. The organization is called by those inside &quot;The Family&quot; even though it no longer cares about a prospective recruit's skin color or family background.</p>
<p><strong>Missions for the Ulmians:</strong> The Ulmians are a full service outfit, and when you mess with a family client you are messing with <em>The Family</em>, capiche? Very frequently, the Ulmians will send teams to clear up some &quot;misunderstanding&quot; involving one or more Ulmi clients. These sorts of missions will often involve bailing clueless supernaturals out of legal problems with the mortal world or covering up potential Vow of Silence breaches before they come to Syndicate attention. The Ulmians are also quite aggressive in business and may send teams to &quot;persuade&quot; potential clients to sign on with the Ulmians before someone gets hurt.</p>
<p><strong>Sample Adventure:</strong> An ancient vampire in good standing with the Covenant has awoken and is trying to do things the &quot;old ways&quot;. The Ulmi want the family member to take his friends off to convince this powerful but dangerously naïve monster to allow family specialists to handle his interface with modern society (and pay the going rates for this service, natch).</p>
<p><strong>The Ulmians as Antagonists:</strong> As an essentially criminal organization, it is entirely thinkable that the Ulmians would take time out of their day to put &quot;the squeeze&quot; on one of the player characters, or someone that one of the player characters cares about. Furthermore, their zombie raising can get out of hand relatively easily. Necromancers run amok is the cause for at least 20% of all zombie uprisings according to Covenant records.</p>

<h3 id="the-white-lotus"><a class="header" href="#the-white-lotus">The White Lotus</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;The flower is beautiful because it is temporary.&quot;</em></p>
<p>The White Lotus Benevolence Society is a quasi-Confucianist and ultra marketized extortion racket that has gotten way out of control. Created by some rather inventive Dryads in the 1500s, the original scam was one in which sorcerers would show up to a village and demand Hell Money to keep peoples' ancestors <em>in hell</em>, without which the ancestors would come back to annoy and threaten the living. If people refused to pay, the White Lotus would create or let loose genuine monsters on the populace until payments were made. While quite successful at accumulating lucre, this quickly came to the baleful attention of the World Crime League as a threat to both conventional extortion rackets and (more importantly) the Vow of Silence. Discovering themselves up against a larger and frankly more organized group of supernaturals, the White Lotus' fight was quickly strangled out of them and their remaining members were brought to heel.</p>
<p>But while the White Lotus bent knee to the World Crime League, they never really integrated themselves into the Syndicate structure. They maintained their enforcement arm, who are called the Thorns of the Lotus. And while officially they are not supposed to run around murdering people with overt evil magical power, they still totally do that when they think they aren't going to get caught. But the main branch claimed to pretty much get out of the crime game and pursue their second love: which apparently was feng shui and topiary grooming. This is, of course, a sham. What the White Lotus is actually doing is acquiring portals to Maya by any means necessary.</p>
<p>The leader of the White Lotus is referred to as &quot;The Center of the Lotus&quot; and he is a venerable man whose blood is sap long formed into pitch. All other members are judged in worth purely in terms of how much &quot;Hell Money&quot; they have. Whenever members of the White Lotus do anything for each other, Hell Money changes hands. No longer the &quot;genuine&quot; coins that Lotus extortionists pretended to burn away in front of superstitious lords and bureaucrats, the modern Lotus Hell Money is kept track of by computer and also available in the form of red script. Portals to the Dreamlands are called &quot;dragon circles&quot; by the geomancers of the White Lotus.</p>
<p>The White Lotus has its own guiding principals that would cause Confucius to label them as monsters - which coincidentally they already do for themselves. Of central importance is their concept of <em>Xiào</em> as a fear-based imperative to avoid ancestral judgment and cut one's self off from mortal human family. Below that is <em>Zhōng</em>, which to the Lotus is the concept that one's personal obligation to others begins and ends with the payment of Hell Money. Petals of the Lotus have an obligation to complete contracts, but to do more than that is to shame one's self. Of rough equivalence is <em>Ren</em>, or &quot;upward mobility&quot;. Each member of the White Lotus is expected to chafe at their current station and be constantly striving to displace those above themselves. And finally there is <em>Li</em>, which is simply the imperative to appear to be doing something else than what you are doing and to change your tactics and nightly routines as often as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Missions for the White Lotus:</strong> The thing the White Lotus wants more than anything else is <em>land</em>. You can't monopolize the dragon lines that connect the portals to Maya if you don't have a lot of land. And acquiring land requires all kinds of mission types in After Sundown. From Wild West style &quot;convince the shepherds to sell&quot; jobs to espionage and even dungeon-crawls to find out key information about potential sites for acquisition.</p>
<p><strong>Sample Adventure:</strong> Lotus geomancers found records of what they believe to be a dragon circle in a temple situated in the jungles of Northern Burma. The temple is well into disuse because apparently the forests around it are called &quot;the trees of hungry ghosts&quot; by the local Khmer tribes. There is Hell Money in it for you if you see what that's all about and take over the dragon circle or at least determine that there isn't one there that the White Lotus does not control.</p>
<p><strong>The White Lotus as Antagonists:</strong> In addition to having a strong tradition of terrorizing and brutally murdering people, The White Lotus are essentially the villains from like every Scooby Doo episode ever. Only with actual magical powers. You can watch pretty much any Scooby Doo show from any season and port the plot right over with no problem. Old man Winters is going to have to sell the ski resort because people aren't going since the rumors of haunting started up? Sure, why not?</p>

<h3 id="the-wreckers"><a class="header" href="#the-wreckers">The Wreckers</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;It is when pirates count their booty that they become mere thieves.&quot;</em></p>
<p>The Wreckers are an anti-establishment organization that recruits from the dregs and exiles of societies. Lacking a common language, they formed their own system of simple symbols and music to communicate ideas back and forth. This is less of an issue in the modern age when almost everyone can say at least a few words in at least one of the major languages in the world, but in ages past the chances of any two exiles having words in common was pretty small. The symbol for the Wreckers is a black spot, and to this night if someone &quot;gives you The Black Spot&quot; it indicates that the Wreckers have it in for you.</p>
<p>Many feel that the Wreckers are just a bunch of pirates and highwaymen who rob shipments and waylay travelers. And that's kind of true, and was substantially more true in the past. Tonight, the Black Spot members have a set of shared beliefs, but they are pretty confused. The key part of it is to destroy everything that <em>you</em> don't like, as part of the larger plan of sinking everything into entropy and dissolution. They reach out to those who have been wronged and offer vengeance of a sort. Frequent mentions are made of the &quot;Inevitability of the final reckoning.&quot; But at the core, the Black Spot wants to take anarchy to the next level: destroying Truth and connectivity.</p>
<p>But the Wreckers do not just paint themselves with mud and wait for society to fall apart. Instead they plot well in advance and try to seize the reins of civilization and tear them asunder. It is this justification that leads them to attack rails, trucks, and shipping lanes. But they have deeper games they play that involve <em>much</em> more than simple banditry. Infiltration, smear campaigns, impersonation, and so on. Well aware of the power of the monolith that is social cohesion, they work to monkey wrench both institutions and social contracts, and are quite adept at spreading misinformation.</p>
<p><strong>Missions for the Wreckers:</strong> The Black Spot hires out a fair number of agents provocateur. Disseminating harmful rumors and starting fights. If there's an organization, you can bet that the Wreckers want you to infiltrate it and sabotage it from within. Terrorism and vandalism are not beneath them, they <em>aspire</em> to these activities.</p>
<p><strong>Sample Adventure:</strong> A member of the Fallen Empire has put together the goods to enact a mighty ritual of vast power to try to conquer the world. The Wreckers have no intention of letting anyone unite the world, and have set the player characters up with the means to get into the ziggurat.</p>
<p><strong>The Wreckers as Antagonists:</strong> Even if you are <em>with</em> them you're still against them. Pretty much anyone could plausibly be a Black Spot mole playing the long game. And the Wreckers take tremendous pride in this fact, and actively encourage groups to turn on themselves with Inquisitions and McCarthyism. It's difficult to imagine such behavior hurting their cause by removing their agents more than it helps their cause by sowing distrust and conflict on its own.</p>

<p><em>&quot;No chains will ever hold that...&quot;</em></p>
<p>The wilderness of horror movies is a forbidding place full of horrible things. And in the realm of horror, a fair number of those things are merely <em>dangerous</em> and horrible rather than <em>malicious</em> and horrible. Giant Animals are likely to fall into that category, because they are <em>animals</em> and generally of animal intelligence. However, it is important to note that in After Sundown, as in too many horror books and movies to mention, animals are entirely capable of being decidedly, premeditatedly, <em>evil</em>. Animals in After Sundown really tend to be amazing jerks. So when animals are given great strength or amazing powers, they usually go on rampages pretty near to first thing. </p>
<p>The wilderness of Maya gives birth to nightmarish and titanic beasts beyond number. And the magic of that untamed land bleeds into the material world in unpredictable ways. Where this happens, monstrosities are created and normal beasts are transformed into monstrosities. The wilderness in the After Sundowncan be a truly horrible place full of horrible things. And the horrible things it is full of are collectively known as the Giant Animals.</p>

<p>Magically enhanced monstrous beasts prowl the wilds of the astral plane, and sometimes their rampages take them through holes in reality to invade the mortal world. In areas unseen by man, animals will sometimes spontaneously grow to magically augmented size and then rampage from there. Behemoths look pretty much like mortal animals save that they are substantially larger than their natural kin and <em>substantially</em> more aggressive and dangerous to humans.</p>
<p>A Behemoth's Giant Size is always on, and it is important to note that sometimes they are of a type of creature which is itself <em>normally</em> 3.5 meters or more such as giant anacondas and the like. Giant Size in this case represents a proportional increase for such creatures, meaning a rough doubling in all dimensions and an increase in mass by approximately 10 times. A Behemoth was never human, but it is a real creature, and before considering its Giant Size and Potency, it uses the normal stats of an animal of its type.</p>
<p>A Behemoth has an Astral power source and a Lunar power schedule. As Giant Animals they are vulnerable to silver and weakened by alcohol.</p>

It may seem like they can't possibly be fought with weapons, since there's about a fantastillion of them in each swarm. But the reality is that the Swarm itself is completely meaningless. They &quot;are&quot; an intangible energy field that whips mundane beasts into a frenzy of violence. As such, one simply has to hit the intangible force between the controlled beasts with silver until it stops moving.</p>

<p><em>&quot;That is simply unnatural.&quot;</em></p>
<p>In the heart of Maya there are animals that don't really look like Earthly animals at all. Sometimes they look like two or more creatures melded together awkwardly, and sometimes they just look like something drawn up for <a href="http://www.heavymetal.com/">Heavy Metal</a>. These are the Chimera, and some of them look like mythic beasts such as unicorns and basilisks. And it is important to note that they actually <em>behave</em> like those legendary monsters do <em>in horror movies</em>. Which means that mostly what they do is wander around and use their powers to murder people. Chimeras are about the size of a horse and are not cuddly at all.</p>
<p>A Chimera has the mind of an animal, and the physique of a horrible man-eating monster. Since they aren't even reasonable facsimiles of humans, they not only have a non-standard attribute array but indeed fairly fixed attributes and skills. They <em>do</em> have a Potency rating, and sometimes these values increase. Whether they have a spiral horn or a scorpion's tail, a Chimera has natural weaponry that inflict 3 Lethal damage.</p>

<p><em>&quot;What the hell is that?&quot;<br />
&quot;We need bigger guns.&quot;</em></p>
<p>There are things in the wilderness of horror that defy ready analysis. Some are really, <em>really</em> big. And they stomp out of nightmares and crush everything beneath their feet. They are the Kaiju, and they have no place in the modern world. Standing at something over 15 meters tall, these prehistoric beasts are awe inspiringly terrifying. It's not even <em>entirely</em> clear that these titanic monstrosities are even magical in nature, and indeed most of them don't seem to use any magical powers save for being really big.</p>
<p>Whether they are giant lizards or giant apes, their stats are pretty much the same. Their Clout abilities let them exist beyond the limit where a normal animal would collapse under the strain of their own weight. Mostly they just rely on their size. They don't even have something that counts as special natural weaponry, their normal attack is a base zero normal damage fist - and they are so big that attacking a human-sized target suffers a -5 penalty to the attack roll - and they <em>still</em> normally flatten things in one pound - because that's how a creature with a 35 strength <em>rolls</em>.</p>
<p>Kaiju can work as &quot;boss monsters&quot; in that they are so out of scale with even large and in-charge characters that finding something that can hurt them <em>at all</em> can be an adventure in itself.</p>

<p><em>&quot;There's no sense in getting killed by a plant.&quot;</em></p>
<p>The lands of Maya are filled with strange foliage. But strangest of all is the foliage that harbors a deep hatred for people and animals. Possessed of an intelligence that is so wholly unlike those of humanity's that they are difficult to measure, these plants are condemned universally as being &quot;Evil&quot; even by the jaded standards of supernatural society. Completely emotionless, Evil Plants are not motivated by passions and cannot be induced to frenzy nor convinced against a course of action with emotional argument of any kind.</p>
<h3 id="creepers"><a class="header" href="#creepers">Creepers</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;It waits till we’re weak before it reveals its strength.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Creepers are the weakest of the Evil Plants, but are subtle and insidious nonetheless. The real body of the creeper is a system of interlocking rhizomatic roots that lie underground or parasitically buried into other plants that emerge only to creep their way into weakened prey. From these roots spring myriad possible forms, most commonly brightly colored flowering vines or apparent patches of beautiful wild flowers. Disturbing these flowers subjects the area to clouds of sticky poison that (most commonly) drives everyone in the area to hallucinatory madness as the vines and roots begin their slow emergence to trap them in place.</p>
<p>Creepers are obviously quite dangerous to cultivate, but people sometimes try anyway as they can be coaxed or bred into producing particular poisons or reagents useful in Bitter Fruit recipes.</p>
<p>Creepers have a nonstandard attribute array because they were never humans. Creepers have no Agility or ability to move outside of using Grass Rope to extend parts of themselves or the plants that they exist alongside and have no personalities to exercise Charisma, but very old and well-fed Creepers could resemble a forest of mangroves or aspens more than a cluster of vines. Before their Potency modifier their attribute ranges are:</p>
<p>S: 1/12 A: 0/0 I: 5/10 L: 1/1 W: 1/6 C: 0/0 E: 0/0 P: 1</p>
<p>A Creeper has an Astral power source and a Feeding power schedule - any lost Magic Points are restored by consuming bodies. As with other Evil Plants they are vulnerable to iron and weakened by alcohol - spraying an area down can prevent them from extending their roots until it evaporates.</p>

<p><em>&quot;Feed Me!&quot;</em></p>
<p>Mantraps are essentially Aubrey the monster from Little Shop of Horrors or the carnivorous plants from Mario Brothers. They are able to move their giant mouth quite quickly, but they are rooted to the ground and cannot effectively give chase. Brutally effective ambush hunters, Mantraps try to eat animals whenever the opportunities arise.</p>
<p>Mantraps can't readily transport themselves across the land, let alone the borders between the dreamlands and the material world. Nevertheless, they do appear on Earth, because there are those who for whatever reason dig them up and transplant them. They often appear as guard plants in Marduk Society compounds. Mantraps can learn to speak, and their muppet-like countenance creates alien voices.</p>
<p>The huge woody maw of a Mantrap is a damage 3 weapon, and, yes, it does count as wood for the purpose of supernatural vulnerabilities. Mantraps have a nonstandard attribute array because they were never humans. Before their Potency modifier their attribute ranges are:</p>

<p><em>&quot;I dunno what the hell's in there, but it's weird and pissed off, whatever it is.&quot;</em></p>
<p>The Triffids are mobile plant monsters that are only vaguely describable as humanoid in shape. Like other Evil Plants, they need meat in their diet, but unlike the others they can get up and walk at a normal speed. As such, Triffids are not relegated to ambush hunting, they can seriously chase their prey down and eat them. And they do.</p>
<p>A Triffid has a poison barb on the end of each meter long tendril that extends from their maw. Some of them sprout leaves and/or flowers from various parts of their body. Some of them are instead smooth like an ivy vine or wrinkled like a redwood tree. It's not entirely clear what the significance of that distinction is.</p>
<p>The vicious barbed tendrils of a Triffid constitute a damage 3 weapon that can deliver the poison of the Triffid's &quot;bite&quot;. Triffids have a nonstandard attribute array because they were never humans. Before their Potency modifier their attribute ranges are:</p>

<p><em>&quot;There are others... they'll stop you!&quot;<br >
&quot;In an hour, you won't want them to.&quot;</em></p>
<p>The Pods are psychic hazards that take over people and use them to make more pods and take more people over. It's a rather disturbing pyramid scheme, and it is not uncommon for even the Marduk Society and the Communes to work together in order to unravel Pod cults. It's not especially clear what it is that Pods <em>want</em>, but whatever it is, they appear to have no intention of discussing it with any political structures from the material world.</p>
<p>Each pod is roughly the size of a large watermelon and appears to be a massive green potato. Most pods have some milk white tendrils growing out of what is most probably the bottom. These look similar to the rootlets that grow out of a potato if you leave it in water for a long period of time. There are slight depressions all over the Pod that appear to be its &quot;eyes&quot; - they are able to see things through them and use Authority on victims who look at them. The tendrils of a Pod can only move by growing over the course of minutes and hours, so for any practical purposes they are essentially immobile. Pods have a nonstandard attribute array because they were never humans. Before their Potency modifier their attribute ranges are:</p>
<p>S: 1/1 A: 0/0 I: 5/12 L: 5/12 W: 5/12 C: 4/10 E:1/6 P: 3</p>

<p>All Fey have an Astral Power Source and suffer aggravated wounds from iron. Before humanity had iron, there were Fey outposts on Earth: cruel and barbarous slaveholding affairs that sculpted the land to be more like Limbo. When iron came to human hands, the Fey were wiped from the Earth. This historical footnote has been obscured, since of course the obvious parallels possible with other supernatural creatures is enough to give any Covenant Prelate pause.</p>

<p><em>&quot;We've slain the monsters of the world until they skulk in darkness like rats. Did you really think the darkness would protect you?&quot;</em></p>
<p>In ages past the mighty sky wizard Marduk fought with the great Tiamat and slew her, saving humanity from her dark tyranny. As the savior of humanity, Marduk became a wise and just king who ruled over Sumeria thousands of years ago. He passed his magic down to disciples, and in classic fashion they perverted everything Marduk stood for and are now a terrifying edifice.</p>
<p>The Marduk Society retains the ancient magics of Marduk himself and continue to hunt supernaturals, nominally to save humanity from the oppression of supernatural influences. However, the leadership of the Marduk Society actually <em>are</em> supernatural creatures. After ruthlessly hunting down the spawn of Tiamat for generations they found that they were able to grant themselves immortality by eating the flesh of Leviathans, a practice which in reality transforms their elite membership <em>into</em> Leviathans. The sorceries left behind by Marduk are in truth no different from the sorceries of any Witch, and thus it is that the core membership of the Marduk Society are no different from other supernaturals save for the hat they wear and their intense desire to not get along.</p>
<p>Marduk's magic draws heavily upon human fear and suffering to use as power. However, while the historical Marduk apparently used this as justification to wander the lands righting wrongs and saving the endangered, the modern incarnation conspires to make mortal governments oppressive and ruin the lives of children. Ideally they claim that once their war is won they will make all human society utopic, but there is no particular reason to believe this is true.</p>
<p><strong>Sample Encounter:</strong> A black van pulls up and six men in black suits get out. They are reasonably professional, have tranq guns and heavy pistols and strongly suggest that the protagonists get into the van. A couple of them are even mutants, and it's probably best to not think about how they got that way.</p>

<p><em>&quot;Everything is a scam to you, isn't it?&quot;<br />
&quot;Damn right it is.&quot;</em></p>
<p>The Mirror Goblins are hideous and seemingly subhuman. They are small and misshapen, and they have hideous hooked teeth and claws. Mirror Goblins are a lot like the Black Isz from The Maxx or the Mumblers from Silent Hill. Left to their own devices, they mostly wander around Limbo gibbering and periodically eating each other. However, they are also oppressed by more powerful residents of the Dark Reflection. Whipped into shape by stronger creatures and groups they are used as disposable fodder and monsters of the week by The King with Three Shadows and other Infernal groups. Since they always have a Potency of zero, a Mirror Goblin can pass through any portal to Limbo, which is where they get their name: literally goblins who come into the Mortal World through mirrors.</p>
<p>While Mirror Goblins have strange pacmanesque mouths and rarely stand much over a meter tall, their muppetlike visages seem to have little difficulty being understood in human languages. When combined with their ability to magically disguise themselves, Mirror Goblins can actually penetrate human society with tolerable ease. They dare not stay long in the Mortal World though, because their power ritual can only be performed in Limbo. Mirror Goblins are generally regarded as being less than fully trustworthy.</p>
<p>The best media to look through to get a handle on Mirror Goblins is The Maxx, as they pretty much look and act like the Isz.</p>
<p>A Mirror Goblin was never human and has a nonstandard attribute array:</p>
<p>S: 3/8, A: 5/10, I: 4/10, L: 3/8, W: 3/8, C: 3/8</p>

These beings look like hunks of maggot infested meat in an only barely humanoid shape, and they are quite boneless until they invoke their Giant Size and War Form, which are always enacted together. At that point their worms and flesh are pulled tight over a scaffold of long wet bones that end in sharp points in many places.</p>
<p>When a Spriggan performs its power ritual, it covers itself in spoiled food and soiled goods. The worms crawl out of it and grasp filth and offal to pull back into their cavernous interiors. Spriggans are quite susceptible to their Master Passion: Despair.</p>
<p>A Spriggan was never human and has a nonstandard attribute array:</p>

<p>Gremlins are not old creatures. For all anyone knows, goblins have been more-or-less the same for millennia, but when humans started using complex machines to mine into the earth something new came out of the Dark Reflection. What might have at first been Mirror Goblins took to machinery and industry in a way that had never been seen before. Superstitious humans blamed them for ruining the ore in their mines and knocking in the tunnels pretending to be lost men and called them kobolds and knockers and (correctly) blamed all sorts of accidents and cantankerous machinery on them.</p>
<p>Gremlins didn't become widely known by that name until World War II, when they became part of RAF propaganda (a move that was no doubt clever propaganda on the part of the Communes in turn). They seemed to have grown in numbers as industrialization spread around the world.
Gremlins look like small, withered humans with spikes growing out of their spines and joints, large strange eyes, and small but nasty and sharp claws and teeth. They're not actually much brighter than Mirror Goblins, but they have a low cunning and an instinctive understanding of machines and technology of all kinds. Gremlins are drawn to machines and to kill people, but they tend to be divided between those that attach to a particular machine and those that drift about looking for new opportunities. They seam to feed on destruction; their power ritual requires them to connect with a machine that has killed someone.</p>

<p><em>&quot;Skin... Graaaaah... Tasty...&quot;</em></p>
<p>Within the prison world that is the Deep Reflection, hideous ogres prowl and punish or even murder those unlucky enough to fall into their clutches. But while they are the jailers of this foul realm, they are also its prisoners. Trolls spend almost every moment of their existence in agony and dejection, and eagerly take out their pains on others.</p>
<p>Hulking brutes with bulging musculature and an inhuman appearance, Trolls cannot actually turn their Giant Size <em>off</em>. These tortured giants of Limbo appear in literature as Tartarians and Pyramid Head. Trolls regain power by feeding on living things, often simply by swallowing them whole in their gaping maws. </p>
<p>Trolls have a fairly multivarious appearance, varying from merely oversized humans to lumpy stone skinned oni with tremendous tusks. These changes are generally speaking purely cosmetic. Trolls have no difficulty recognizing different Trolls as being the same as themselves.</p>
<p>Trolls have a nonstandard attribute array because they were never humans. Before their Potency modifier and their constant Giant Size, their attribute ranges are:</p>

<p><em>&quot;Match wits with a creature older than time? Match wits with a prince of the dark dominions?&quot;</em></p>
<p>The Demons were seemingly around a lot longer than other supernatural creatures: the oldest records left by vampires or the recollections of the Returned allow for the civilization of the Demons as having been around for unfathomable years even then. This makes their predicament something of a puzzle, because every Demon is imprisoned in Limbo to a greater degree than any of its other inhabitants. Who or <em>what</em> imprisoned the Demons there is not particularly clear, and individual Demons advance distinct theories when asked. All Demons live forever, and many of them <em>are</em> frightfully old. Many of them claim to have been around during &quot;The Great Banishment&quot; - but in almost all cases this is certainly a lie. It's not even clear where the banishment was <em>from</em>. Some claim that it was the Material World, while others claim that the original Demonic home world was Maya. Still others claim that it was some as yet unnamed world that they cannot return to. What is clear is that Demons have a tremendous difficulty leaving the Dark Reflection: their Potencies are considered four higher for purposes of overcoming the Gauntlet.</p>
<h3 id="akuma"><a class="header" href="#akuma">Akuma</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;I always get what I want because I take it.&quot;</em></p>
<p>The Akuma were never human and this fact cannot easily escape onlookers. Standing about a meter taller than a man, Akuma are also blessed with extra... parts. Rows of teeth, third eyes, sometimes even extra arms or mouths. Many come equipped with extra parts that are not analogous to any found in normal people such as horns, pincers, and tentacles. They come in colors like red and blue rather than the tan and slightly darker tan that humans are familiar with. Even the white ones are <em>white</em>, rather than merely a slightly paler shade of tan. These are the demons you imagine when your imagination has a bottomless budget for costuming. </p>
<p>Akuma need to feed on sapients in order to restore their powers. Left on their own in the Dark Reflection they foist mirror goblins into their maws with wild abandon, but they prefer the flesh of humans. While Akuma do not strictly speaking <em>need</em> to eat, they love doing so and their gluttonous appetites cannot be sated easily or long. Akuma are a huge social problem for mortals and supernaturals alike when they appear in the material world, for they lack subtlety in any of their dealings. Akuma are lazy bullies whose only redeeming feature is that at least their short sighted avarice makes them easy to manipulate by those with sufficient power to not be devoured right off. An Akuma has no Driving Ambitions, and is dominated by Master Passions of Rage, Hunger, and Fear.</p>
<p>While it is <em>possible</em> for an Akuma to gain power nonfatally from a victim, their love of livers and poor discipline ensure that this almost never happens. An Akuma cannot turn their Giant Size off. An Akuma's claws, horns, teeth, or whatever constitute a damage 3 weapon (including their monstrous size). Akuma have a nonstandard attribute array because they were never humans. Before their Potency modifier and their constant Giant Size, their attribute ranges are:</p>
<p>S: 6/11 A: 1/5 I: 1/3 L: 1/3 W: 2/7 C: 1/4 E: 0/6 P: 2</p>

<h3 id="asura"><a class="header" href="#asura">Asura</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;And for revenge thou hast created this demon. Her domain is darkness - her purpose is wickedness.&quot;</em></p>
<p>The Asura appear as relatively attractive, if distant and cruel humans. As the only type of Demon that is not constitutively required to eat or torture people to death, they are the most likely to have neutral or positive relations with residents of the mortal world. Nevertheless, Asura very rarely behave in any manner that could be even generously described as less than unnecessarily dickish. While they gain no literal sustenance from harming people, they are often pressed into the service of powerful Ifrit to do so and just plain seem to like doing it.</p>
<p>Some Asura have wings that resemble those of swans or bats growing from their backs. The ones that don't have either wheels of fire or tiny clouds appear under their feet when they fly. While technically a Asura was never a human, they are close enough in appearance and capabilities that their attribute ranges before Potency modifiers are human standard.</p>
<p>Asura are superficially similar to Daeva, and it is primarily for this reason that Daeva were often subject to persecution by Covenant forces about 400 years ago. More extensive investigations recognize many key differences. For example, while a Daeva is born as a human luminary and is converted into a Vampire upon death at another's hands, a Asura comes into being by coalescing out of ash in Limbo, already fully grown. Blood flows in the veins of a Daeva only when they have recently fed, while blood does not actually exist inside a Asura at all - when their skin is broken it cracks like porcelain and a fine ash drifts out.</p>
<p>Asura easily insinuate themselves in leadership positions in the mortal world because of their tremendous and magically augmented presence. These qualities are held in no esteem whatsoever in Demonic culture, and mere likability is treated with extreme contempt. Virtually all Asura have been made to swear total vassalage to a more powerful Asura or Ifrit. Domination, whether magical in nature or simple brute force is the currency of Demonic relationships. An Asura's power ritual is a bitter ash-eating affair that leaves their throat parched and their eyes red and raw. Asura suffer from Master Passion: Loneliness, though demonic society is actually so unsympathetic to relationships that few of them actually understand that fact.</p>
<p>Some Asura have enough extra disciplines to put them on a roughly equal footing with starting player characters of other supernatural types. While still being totally inhuman, Asura are <em>by far</em> the most player-friendly of the extra-terrestrials. It is still rather difficult roleplaying, because they were never humans, have no aspirations to ever <em>be</em> humans, and were at no points in their un-Earthly lives ever confused on any of those points. But still, with some work, it can be done.</p>
<p>An Asura has an Infernal power source and a Ritual power schedule. As Demons they are vulnerable to silver and weakened by water.</p>

<h3 id="ifrit"><a class="header" href="#ifrit">Ifrit</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;I don't need you dead, just for you to wish you were.&quot;</em></p>
<p>By far the rarest and most terrifying denizens of Limbo are the Ifrit. They are not especially powerful physically, and indeed they are normally intangible when encountered. But they have incredible mystical powers, almost unmatched amongst supernatural creatures. Not a few of them have taken to passing themselves off as gods when they reach the material world, and yet they have never achieved much status within any of the major earthly syndicates. This is primarily because as a group they do not normally join supernatural syndicates - even the King with Three Shadows counts few Ifrit under his dominion. </p>
<p>An Ifrit can look like anything, and they do. But in their truest form they seem to be hideous humanoids of approximately 2 meters with craggy skin of vivid primary and secondary colors. Their vibrant hues appear like something more at home in a crayon box than a living being.</p>
<p>In order to feed, an Ifrit must be within a meter of someone in wracking agony. They do not have to actually consume any blood or viscera and indeed they generally cannot because they are incorporeal anywhere but the Depths of Limbo. While Ifrit were probably never living mortals, their attributes are normal for their Potency.  It's not entirely clear if Ifrit ever <em>were</em> anything before being magical beings, no one knows of any of them coming into being, and the lowest Potency of any Ifrit seems to be 4.</p>
<p>An Ifrit has an Infernal power source and a Feeding power schedule. As Demons they are vulnerable to silver and weakened by water.</p>

<p><em>&quot;How nice of you to join us. You can share the same fate they are going to suffer.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Long ago a powerful mortal king married a queen of the fairies. Abandoning his kingdom of men to wither and die, he took a new name and attained everlasting life with a grim bargain with Demons. A bargain that ultimately hurled his kingdom into the deepest pits of the Dark Reflection. The King with Three Shadows has become as the fairy are, and he lives forever without changing. He is now their dark king, and commands the mirror goblins - an army of fairies and demons which do his dark bidding. He is supported in his endeavors by three powerful Fairies - The Three Shadows of the King.</p>
<p>Fairies and Demons have a difficult time getting to the world of man at all, and must pass through a reflective surface to do so. More powerful fairies and demons need more specific mirrors through which to pass, and thus usually require that these doorways be custom built to draw them through. While a minor mirror goblin might be able to come through a pool of water or a pane of glass, powerful demons need a mirrored surface of exacting specifications - for example one might require a mirror at least 2 meters across made of bronze and polished with olive oil, lemon juice, and human blood.</p>
<p>The King with Three Shadows himself requires a titanic and exacting mirror to again trod upon the Earth, and it is thus that he is forced to send minions through the portals to acquire the strange materials and specific events they need to allow him to march across the threshold with his demonic army to conquer the human world.</p>
<p><strong>Sample Encounter:</strong> Four mirror goblins are running down the sidewalk of the broad suburban street with an empty sack. As they pass, the streetlights flicker and dim, keeping them in the shadows. If the protagonists follow them, they see the gibbering villains break into a nondescript house and come out again with a struggling sack about the size of a young child. They then clamber back down the street and meep their way into a <em>different</em> house. If still unmolested, they make their way to the bathroom mirror and make good their escape.</p>

<p><em>&quot;It is a truth universally acknowledged that a zombie in possession of brains must be in want of more brains.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Zombies are physical bodies without the benefit of life or human spirit who nonetheless move about and hunger for the brains of the living. They are not respected members of the supernatural community, but are instead treated as servitors and disposable soldiers by those with necromantic powers and a social problem by most everyone else. Zombies are not traditionally considered playable, but are instead most likely to appear as tools or independent menaces in an After Sundown campaign.</p>
<p>All Zombies, regardless of strength, have an Orphic power source. When an extra becomes a Zombie, they become a Shambler or a Soulless depending upon the circumstances of their transformation. When a Luminary becomes a Zombie, they become a Revenant in all cases. Unlike many unplayable types, a Zombie <em>is</em> made out of a human being and they <em>are</em> a template added to a normal human statline.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="luminary-zombies"><a class="header" href="#luminary-zombies">Luminary Zombies</a></h3>
<p>When Luminaries become zombies they never turn into Shamblers or Soulless (unless they're missing their soul or something like that) but arise as Revenants. As they intended as a playable type with some presence in monstrous society the description and starting powers of Revenants is given under the Outliers section rather than with other Zombies.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="voodoo-and-the-zombi"><a class="header" href="#voodoo-and-the-zombi">Voodoo and the Zombi</a></h3>
<p>While the word &quot;Zombie&quot; comes undeniably from Caribbean Creole and ultimately derives from West Africa, the Zombies of After Sundown don't have a lot to do with that particular mythology or how it is interpreted in modern popular culture. People brought to slavish near-death by drugs or potions are better represented with the Mind Root power than with Reanimate.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="shamblers"><a class="header" href="#shamblers">Shamblers</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;When the dead rise, civilization will fall.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Shamblers are the classic &quot;slow zombies&quot; from zombie movies from the eighties. They hunger for brains, but they are basically walking corpses who shamble around - hence the name. Shamblers are <em>not</em> individually particularly dangerous. But they <em>are</em> implacable and they can come in fairly large numbers. Created by Orphic sorcery or by leakage of power from Mictlan, Shamblers will thoughtlessly move toward humans and attempt to eat their brains. The opening up of a major Well to Mictlan is often accompanied by the mass animation of large numbers of corpses as Shamblers, leading to potentially terrifying armies of the things even in the face of the relative incompetence of any solitary Shambler.</p>
<p>A Shambler has no Charisma or Logic score and automatically fails any test it would be called upon to make. Upon creation, a Shambler's Agility is reduced by one (to a minimum of 1) but their Strength is increased by 1. A Shambler loses their Logic, Charisma, and Willpower attributes and all of their skills, even combat skills. When not controlled magically, they really will simply walk over and relentlessly and unskillfully claw and bite at potential victims with their substantial but undirected strength. Shamblers are not specifically slower than a normal person, but they <em>always</em> move at the rate of a Careful Walk even when ordered to do otherwise. Only their literally endless endurance and willingness to travel unceasingly to find brains gives their aggregate daily travels a frightening total of up to 50 kilometers a day. </p>
<p>When Shamblers arise after the death of a human infested with the Z-Virus they can continue to spread it, although this tends not to matter to much because they usually try to eat what they kill and thus the infection doesn't spread <em>too</em> quickly. On the other hand, when Mictlan wells open up the evil magic that animates them will continue to work until the gateway itself closes. </p>
<p>The skin of a Shambler is quite resilient and hard, and their fists are Damage 1N weapons. Shamblers have no passions, but their behavior is in some ways comparable to a very slow Master Passion Hunger frenzy. A few Shamblers end up with powers such as Vigor or Armored in Life, or Bite of the Serpent (Necrotic).</p>
<p>A Shambler has an Orphic power source, a Feeding Power Schedule, and a Potency of 1, although most never need Magic Points. They never have an Edge attribute. As undead they are vulnerable to wood and weakened by sunlight.</p>

<h3 id="soulless"><a class="header" href="#soulless">Soulless</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;If you look at the whole life of the planet, we... you know, man, has only been around for a few blinks of an eye. So if the infection wipes us all out, that is a return to normality.&quot;</em></p>
<p>The Soulless are the lately fashionable &quot;fast zombies&quot; of more modern cinema. Clearly distinct from Shamblers by their bright red eyes and relatively speedy disposition, the Soulless are neither plodding nor tireless. Possessed of more humanlike speeds and faculties, the Soulless are individually much more terrifying than a Shambler. But while they are rarely spawned in the tremendous numbers of Shamblers, the fact that they can and do spread their affliction readily to the living means that their numbers can easily grow out of control if not checked by heroic intervention.</p>
<p>A Soulless loses their Charisma but not their Logic or Willpower. Their near-constant frenzy means they effectively have an extra point of both Strength and Willpower. A Soulless is consumed by rage at all times to the point of complete irrationality, but they are not actually incapable of utilizing tools. While a Soulless will <em>usually</em> opt to empower Vigor to tear down a door rather than attempting to turn the knob, this is a result of their all consuming hatred rather than actual ineptitude on their part. The Soulless fighting style is simple and predictable, but usually effective enough: all Soulless have a Combat skill of 1.</p>
<p>The bite or even <em>spit</em> of the Soulless can corrupt and kill mortals, with the RAGE Virus spreading rapidly. If they are sterilized by any method, any victims they take down will stay inert. Every Soulless is dominated by both Master Passion Rage and will fly into a Rage Frenzy with basically no provocation at all. Triggers include <em>seeing humans</em>.</p>
<p>A Soulless has Master Passion Rage with an Orphic power source and a Feeding Power Schedule, and a Potency of 1. As undead they are vulnerable to wood and weakened by sunlight.</p>

<p><em>&quot;I was told there was nothing left. No reason, no conscience, no understanding. Not even the most rudimentary sense of life or death, of good or evil, right or wrong. I met this six-year-old child with this blank, pale, emotionless face, and the blackest eyes, the devil's eyes. I spent eight years trying to reach him, and then another seven trying to keep him locked up because I realized that what was living behind that boy's eyes was purely and simply...evil.</em></p>
<p>Sometimes people come back from the dead for seemingly no more reason than their love of killing. Maybe the Gloom just spits them back because Death wants them to keep doing their work. These monstrous and immortal serial killers just keep coming back to kill again and again, and not much ever stops them. Syndicates <em>hate</em> these things, because they almost always murder enough people to attract big investigations that start to turn up weird and unexplainable evidence. They aren't the sort to listen to reason and try to tone it down or keep the killing on the down-low. They have their ritualistic MO and they are going to stick to it, death and society be damned.</p>
<p>Thrillers are disturbingly powerful and it's just possible that a few of them have survived long enough to become elders; like vampires they have a tendency to not stay dead. Although in retrospect they've probably been around for a very long time, Thrillers weren't identified as a distinct type of monster until some troublesome details of the Ripper Killings were examined, and the problem wasn't widely appreciated until the later half of the 20th century when mortal attention to serial killers started to influence supernatural understanding. Syndicates tend to be rather forgiving of things that are done in the name of putting down a Thriller with extreme prejudice - burying the staked heart and brain in separate bags of seeds on different continents is considered merely prudent. </p>
<p>Thrillers vary in their Master Passion - although Rage seems to be the most common - and some of them are disquietingly emotionless, akin to the Emptiness of Evil Plants or Mockeries. Their Driving Ambition is almost always to make another kill according to their ritualistic plan, which means some of them restore Luck at an alarming rate. They have an Orphic power source, a Lunar Power Schedule, and a Potency of 2. As undead they are vulnerable to wood and weakened by sunlight.</p>

<p><em>&quot;What we have here is what we call a non-repeating phantasm.&quot;</em></p>
<p>The most numerous of supernatural creatures is the Ghost. One of them could be created every time someone dies, there are over seven billion people, and the number of deaths is (at least) one per person.</p>
<p>Every Ghost has tremendous difficulty interacting with the material world. They are native to the Gloom, and when they <em>do</em> manage to leave the Mictlan their Empty Body turns on and they are unable to touch any physical object that is not made of wood. Because of their extreme difficulty in interacting with things, Ghosts often make rather limited actors in a story, and are thus ill suited to be main characters.</p>
<p>All Ghosts have an Orphic power source. Their unlives are sad and lonely ones for the most part, and they tend toward Master Passions of Loneliness or Despair.</p>
<h3 id="wisps"><a class="header" href="#wisps">Wisps</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;Oooh...&quot;</em></p>
<p>Wisps are little shadows or colored glows that flit about and scarcely remember that they used to be humans. Individual Wisps are everywhere, and usually fairly inconsequential. Some Wisps make their way to the material world and scare people or try to interact with the world as they remember it being - it's a pretty frustrating experience because they can't actually touch most things.</p>
<p>Wisps primarily interact with an After Sundown chronicle by being utilized by necromancers as spies. Even without being compelled into service Wisps are often quite willing to be helpful to physical beings that can interact with them. Wisps have a Strength score of 1, regardless of what they had in life.</p>
<p>A Wisp has an Orphic power source and a Lunar power schedule. As undead they are vulnerable to wood and weakened by sunlight.</p>

<h3 id="wraiths"><a class="header" href="#wraiths">Wraiths</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;You know, the best way to get rid of ghosts is to clean house.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Wraiths appear as they did in life save with photographic filters applied to make them look washed out and see-through. Each Wraith is a specific person that died, and they tend to have goals that tie into their time while alive or the circumstances of their death. A Wraith that accomplishes its driving goal often dissolves into a happy ending. But sometimes a Luminary Wraith will simply go on and make an unlife for themselves in supernatural society.</p>
<p>Like all Ghosts, a Wraith is only corporeal while within the Gloom, and can only be in the mortal world until the sun rises before being banished back to Mictlan. Each Wraith has a number of things that tie them to the real world called &quot;fetters&quot;. These can be favored objects, their own corpse, or loved ones. In order to regain Magic Points they have to be within a few meters of one of their fetters and interact with it in some obsessive way. If a Wraith loses track of their fetters, they cannot regain Magic Points and are doomed to slowly fade away. If a Wraith attains its primary goal and persists afterwards, they can stop obsessing over the past and make a new life with new fetters.</p>
<p>Some Luminary Wraiths come into being with a lot of extra disciplines, putting them on close to the same footing as a normal player character. Some people might even be tempted to run Wraith chronicles, but that's really very difficult role playing.</p>
<p>A Wraith has an Orphic power source and a Ritual power schedule. As undead they are vulnerable to wood and weakened by sunlight.</p>

<p><em>&quot;They're here...&quot;</em></p>
<p>Poltergeists are accumulations of untold numbers of wisps that have lost their individuality and become spiritual storms. Ruled by rage and quite destructive, Poltergeists can't even speak save to wail and scream. Sometimes they are tied to a location, sometimes they travel around Mictlan like thunderheads. In either case, they usually have some relation to a specific atrocity or another, and will calm down and disperse if someone can figure out how to appease them despite their inarticulate destruction.</p>
<p>Like all Ghosts, a Poltergeist has an Empty Body unless they are in Mictlan. They also have a Charisma and Logic of zero. They have no specific limits for other attributes, and larger storms have more Strength and more Willpower...</p>
<p>A Poltergeist has an Orphic power source and a Lunar power schedule. Unlike most ghosts they almost always have Master Passion Rage. As undead they are vulnerable to wood and weakened by sunlight.</p>

<p><em>&quot;TK&quot;</em></p>
<p>When Wraiths grow old in their unlife and watch everything they care about wither away, sometimes they get worse. Their minds are warped by one frenzy after another as their other fetters fall into history until hatred of the living is all they have left, and then in a vicious cycle that becomes the one thing that sustains them. It's a sad fate, but there's a lot of bad going around in the world of horror and not much reason to care.</p>
<p>The problem is that a rare few these broken souls eventually reach something like Elderhood and develop powers that let them bother the living. A Dybbuk is driven to find ways out of Mictlan to torment mortals, feeding off of their pain and destruction until they can gather the power to possess one and go joyriding in their new body.</p>
<p>A Dybbuk has an Orphic power source and a Feeding power schedule. They are usually dominated by Master Passion Rage. As undead they are vulnerable to wood and weakened by sunlight.</p>

<p><em>&quot;They have learned nothing, and they have forgotten nothing.&quot;</em></p>
<p>According to the Shattered Empire there was once a mighty nation which ruled over all of humanity with magician kings. Where this kingdom actually was, when it existed, who the people were who ran it, and what the cultural traits of it were like are all lost to time. The Shattered Empire calls itself a dozen names: Ur, Atlantis, and Golgatha to name just a few. And while their stories of their glorious days of world ownership are somewhat conflicting, and quite possibly exaggerations or just plain <em>lies</em>, they are nonetheless willing to kill people over their world conquest plans. And that makes them dangerous.</p>
<p>The very top of the Empire is called either the Rain King, the Masked Prophet, or the Once and Future Emperor. Whether these are three different people having a power struggle or one man with a variety of titles is not clear. Cells of the Shattered Empire hide in cave systems, deep in jungles, and on top of forbidding mountains. They collect powerful magics and threaten the world with them.</p>
<p>The primary bones of contention between the Shattered Empire and the other Syndicates have to do with rulership. The Empire holds not only that they should rule all the other supernatural creatures like in the old days, but that they should rule all of the humans like in the old days too. And yes, that really does mean <em>like the old days</em>. Many of the members of the Empire believe that allowing humans to work bronze was a mistake and that such mistakes should be corrected.</p>
<p><strong>Sample Encounter:</strong> The meeting is going well enough when it is announced that a messenger has arrived. A confident and wild-eyed Troglodyte strides into the room dressed in a coarse toga and trailed by some mad looking ghosts. He points his claws accusingly at the city officials and makes the pronouncement that The Empire has uncovered &quot;the great bell&quot; and you all have a fortnight to surrender the city. Then he and the ghosts fade into The Gloom.</p>

<h3 id="prompting-action-the-news"><a class="header" href="#prompting-action-the-news">Prompting Action: The News</a></h3>
<p>Starting each Chapter or even game session with a sort of collected news bulletin is a great tool for the MC because it simultaneously gives the impression of a living and changing world beyond the player characters and presents them with a gradual drip of new information about the world that they can act on. The later is extremely valuable as a way towards having a player-driven Chronicle. It can also contextualize their own past actions by letting them find out about eventual developments that occurred after they stopped giving things their full attention.</p>
<p>While players should be able to take some kind of action based on every news item, it isn't actually necessary that every one of them be a mission in the supernatural world ready to play; sometimes it's okay for there to just be an animal attack that isn't a Behemoth or Lycanthrope. While this may initially seem to just be a red herring dangled to distract the players, and would be if the Chronicle was entirely driven by the MC's agenda, when the players have a degree of control over the broad arc of the narrative it could also mean that a normal animal attack could be an opportunity for them to do their own scheming. Instead of being called to cover up a supernatural event they could take advantage of the situation to frame a rival or create cover for their own violent agendas. Just try to balance the degree to which the news is doing this kind of thing based on your own Chronicle and players and try not to overdo it.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="advancing-goals"><a class="header" href="#advancing-goals">Advancing Goals</a></h2>
<p><em>Ultimately, in every situation, everyone does what they want to do.</em></p>
<p>The realm of horror has pretty much everything in it that our world does, plus several additional planets of essentially equal size full of strange and poorly explored places of mystery. So it is entirely reasonable to have players who simply want to play After Sundown like a four planet sized sandbox. This can be a rewarding experience, but you should take care to make sure that players have some <em>direction</em> so that the game doesn't end up with the characters simply whiling away their immortality (or simple inhuman power in the case of supernatural characters who are not literally immortal) in a booth at Der Wafflehouse wondering what all is going on in the world. When the game direction is player driven in this manner, the core impetus comes not from antagonists or world events but from the different goals that the player characters have.</p>
<p>These goal driven games require a delicate negotiation before they even begin, because if the characters have goals that are not compatible or are even at odds then the game can quickly devolve into a &quot;Let's go this way!&quot; argument or worse: actual in-party combat. That's pretty much the end of the game, and is thus only suited to games of pre-defined limited length for which the end of the game is pretty much already a foregone conclusion.</p>
<p>So it falls to the MC to dangle some plot hooks that player characters might jump on. But it also falls on the MC <em>and</em> the players to make sure that the goals set by the different characters can coexist in the same band and work towards the completion of the same stories. Directly antagonistic goals being advanced by different characters may sound like a cool source of in-game tension and roleplaying, but it actually just sucks. In order to keep things from falling apart into recrimination immediately, the characters all have to be constantly distracted by &quot;bigger problems&quot; like threats to the world and shit, and that basically means that the characters never get to meaningfully interact with their character goals and the entire chronicle is frustratingly on rails the entire time. Fuck that. Players have a mandate to discuss their character's goals with the other players before the chronicles even begin, and even to make adjustments if necessary to make sure that unity within the band remains a possibility.</p>
<p>It is important that players realize that they do not have the &quot;right&quot; to play any character concept that they want. They have a right and a responsibility to play a character who is capable of being involved in the stories that the other characters are participating in. Characters who don't want to do interesting things, who want to be alone, or who simply do not want to do the things that the other characters want to do are not acceptable character concepts. But also remember that this is a <em>cooperative</em> storytelling game, and that an incompatibility between two players' character concepts is not a problem of only one of the players. The players should reconcile their characters together so there is a reason that they would be involved in stories together. Sometimes this can be as simple as one of the players choosing to play a different character; but most of the time it involves both players compromising their characters somewhat.</p>
<p>For very short games it can be okay to have characters of wildly different ideologies thrown together by circumstances and a shared need for survival. Many haunted house movies rely on this conceit as do some seriously excellent pieces of storytelling like the movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0037017/">Lifeboat</a>. But it is important to note that these situations inherently have an end. Once the PCs have defeated the dream assassin stalking them all or escaped from Mindtrap Manor or whatever, it rather stretches believability for them to not go their separate ways. Villain/hero teamups can make great <em>stories</em>, but rarely make any sense as a <em>series</em>.</p>
<h3 id="accumulating-power"><a class="header" href="#accumulating-power">Accumulating Power</a></h3>
<p><em>In 2009, the mayor of Prague 5 gave his mistress a seat on the European Parliament as a romantic gift, putting to shame any gift you or I will ever give to any woman. Diamonds are friendly and all, but <strong>nothing</strong> replaces Power.</em></p>
<p>There is a manner of looking at things where everything is just a means to an end. And to that extent, everything is measurable as to how many ends it can deliver. And the units of that measure are Power. Some people desire power because they have lost sight of the importance of their original goals: spending long periods making concessions to achieve the power to achieve their dreams has burnt out any passion they had for anything but the empty accumulation of power for as long as they live. But for others, the gaining of power is an entirely reasoned goal based in their inherent uncertainty of what needs the future will have and the certainty that greater power to respond to the future must be a good thing. Still others desire specific or general powers for no other reason than that power is <em>fucking awesome</em>. While the villain driven by an unexamined goal to accumulate more power at any cost until the cost of sanity and self are long paid is indeed a reality, there is nothing inherent about the goal of power that leaves anyone any less sane.</p>
<p>Power comes to our world in many forms, and in After Sundown it comes in several additional ones. Gaining resources of any kind can be thought of as power, as can status in any group or any attributes or disciplines. The game system being what it is, the character will be rewarded with <em>some</em> kind of power no matter what stories they participate in. And while that fact can be enough to get the <em>player</em> involved in practically any story, technically the <em>character</em> doesn't know that. The character should probably be uninterested in any potential adventures that don't seem like they have any payoff.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that actually very few missions that After Sundown characters would be offered are devoid of obvious payment in power. Anytime a character does something that other people want them to do, they are doing a favor. And doing a favor for someone else is a lot like lending them money. It makes them owe you favors in return. It gives you power over them, it gives you... <em>power</em>. So while a character motivated wholly or mostly by power can be expected to be kind of a dick about taking on individual tasks, it's not like they won't <em>do</em> it.</p>
<h3 id="changing-the-world"><a class="header" href="#changing-the-world">Changing the World</a></h3>
<p><em>That would look better over there.</em></p>
<p>Everybody has ideas on how to change the world for the better. What constitutes &quot;better&quot; for these purposes is incredibly varied. Maybe they want to change the economic or political structures of the mortal or supernatural societies they are immersed in. Maybe they want to change physical realities or fight wars against the Zombie uprisings to conclusion. Whatever their goals, a goal driven character can generate their own missions based on who their opponents and allies are. This can be a major time saver for the MC, because the goal driven character will simply create plot hooks out of nothing at all. It can also be a major headache for the MC at times when they drop carefully constructed plot hooks in favor of running off GTA style. Without keeping the goals of a goal oriented character in mind, the MC may be forced to &quot;think fast&quot; and run the game by top-of-head or seat-of-pants fairly often.</p>
<p>Change oriented characters are inherently resistant to going on a lot of potential missions. They won't go on missions that appear to hurt their cause or benefit their enemies. They simply <em>will not do them</em>. And that's a problem if you have multiple goal-driven characters in a team. Incompatible goals between players at the table will make the game grind to a halt. It is important to remember that it is the responsibility of the players to make sure their character's goals do not place an undue burden on the other characters.</p>
<h3 id="fame-and-acknowledgement-by-strangers"><a class="header" href="#fame-and-acknowledgement-by-strangers">Fame and Acknowledgement by Strangers</a></h3>
<p><em>Everyone likes doctors, but they aren't famous.</em></p>
<p>Being recognized is considered by some to be &quot;creepy&quot; or even an attack on their person. Fame is not for everyone. And yet, for many people it's virtually the only thing that matters. People will eat bugs for less money than they make at their job just to get on TV being visibly upset. Fame, even <em>stupid</em> fame, is a powerful draw. If you're reading this at any point close to its original publication date, you probably know who Paris Hilton is. And you probably also realize that there are people who would literally kill someone to get the recognition she has as of this writing. Even though most people have a negative opinion of her. In fact, <em>because</em> most people have a negative opinion of her - it means that most people have an opinion about her at all. And that's something the vast majority of people live and die without ever achieving. There is no such thing as bad publicity.</p>
<p>Fame driven characters are well likely to jump on any story hook you dangle in front of them, because accomplishing &quot;stuff&quot; is perhaps one of the best ways to get fame. Especially if they're even a little bit concerned about the relative positivity of their fame. The main struggle is not as much to get them to <em>go</em> on missions, but to get them to drop them afterward. Asking the character to walk away from publishing their successes in full to keep the Vow of Silence and their own safety is much more of a struggle than getting them to go explore a haunted mansion or take on a wicked Troll in the first place.</p>
<p>And you'd think that the pull between people who want a life of quiet privacy and the people who want to be a known face would tear the game in half. And in some cases, you'd be right. It's seriously a strain on the group if some characters want fame and others do not. Not every character wants to solve supernatural mysteries while playing in a rock band. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josie_and_the_Pussycats_%28TV_series%29">Josie and the Pussycats</a> is not for everyone. But it doesn't have to tank the story. Indeed, having a character who <em>wants</em> to take credit for everything can actually be a <em>boon</em> to the characters who want to be left alone. Having a preening camwhore on the team is a godsend for the team Nosferatu who wants to keep their very existence a secret.</p>
<h3 id="hedonism"><a class="header" href="#hedonism">Hedonism</a></h3>
<p><em>Honestly, I have rhythm, I have music, who could ask for anything more?</em></p>
<p>Some characters just want to have fun. Once you live forever, what's left to <em>aspire</em> to but to dress in frilly shirts and practice your bored expressions? On a more serious note, a lot of people put &quot;self actualization&quot; or something like it at the top of their hierarchy of needs. And when you can get anyone to do pretty much anything with fucking mind control, it's not like fulfilling your lesser needs is really all that hard. So pure hedonism makes a lot of sense under the circumstances. That being said, hedonism <em>rarely</em> actually entails spending all your days in an opium fog while fondling the breasts of prostitutes or mind-controlled cheerleaders. Sure, that's one of the roads it can follow, but most flavors of hedonism seek out variety. And that's important for having actual stories to tell.</p>
<p>A hedonistic character can actually make a very reasonable addition to any team, because hanging out with friends and having exciting adventures is a good start towards having good stories to tell to attract the attention of any mind-controlled cheerleaders you happen to meet in an opium den. Such characters are very likely to just say &quot;fuck it&quot; and follow up on whatever plot hook interests the rest of the group.</p>
<p>As an MC it is important to remember that while a hedonistic character offers little resistance to jumping into an adventure, they also aren't very invested in seeing them to completion. If things get too shitty, they'll <em>leave</em>. And that's not the player being a douche and sabotaging &quot;your&quot; story, that's entirely understandable from the perspective of their character. If they find themselves in a no-win situation or everyone in town suddenly wants to kill them or whatever, they're going to advocate for grabbing a bus ticket out of town. It's important therefore to remember that laying it on too thick does not constitute a motivation for characters motivated by &quot;yucks&quot; to complete the adventure at any cost. As the MC, you have to temper sticks with carrots. They are not going to respond to Chicago becoming far too dangerous for them to stay by <em>staying</em>.</p>
<p>For the other players, it is similarly important to not put too heavy a burden on such a character. While they are going along with whatever the other characters want to do, this should not be taken as a license to roll all over them. They don't put up much resistance to helping other characters with their goals because they are not heavily invested in doing one thing or the other, but that equally means that they are not heavily invested in accomplishing the other character's goals either. The number one imposition that a hedonistic character is unlikely to accept is being sidelined. They are here to <em>do stuff</em>, so if you ask them to sit out while your character does stuff alone they will wander off and find adventure of <em>their</em> own. It's easy to think that these players are being disruptive, but in many cases they are simply responding rationally and in-character to abandonment.</p>
<h3 id="recognition-of-your-peers"><a class="header" href="#recognition-of-your-peers">Recognition of your Peers</a></h3>
<p><em>The worst prison is not the one where the other inmates rape you, it's the one where there are no other inmates.</em></p>
<p>Friendship, acceptance, and status within one's peer group is a major motivating factor for all but the most anti-social of humans. And supernatural creatures rarely escape that particular need. Yet, supernatural creatures are inherently relegated to the status of &quot;the other&quot; in many ways by their tremendously different physical and mystical characteristics. From the standpoint of the supernatural creature, perhaps the bitterest aspect of their emergence from the world of humanity is the loss of all the hard-won relationships in the mortal world. Even though they may now be able to control minds and rip a car door off its hinges, in the rat race of life they are truly back to square one. It is entirely fitting thus for a character to make as their goal the accumulation of accolades from their peers.</p>
<p>Who counts as one's &quot;peers&quot; is an entirely arbitrary and deeply personal concern at the best of times. And it is a very strange question to ask of supernatural creatures because they lack many of the commonalties that might seem to link humanity's state one to another. But in a general sense, most supernatural creatures recognize other supernatural creatures as being their &quot;peers&quot;, a decision that relegates their options for socialization to a number that is limited beyond what mortal humans have had to contend with for tens of thousands of years. And so it is that this goal frequently amounts to little more than &quot;I'm going to go wherever my band goes and make sure to get invited to all their parties.&quot; But for the more ambitious it often entails garnering status within their cult and Syndicate.</p>
<p>In any case, the goal is most effectively actualized by going places and doing &quot;stuff&quot;, which means that they should be fairly amenable to altering their plans to include the goals of other characters.</p>
<h3 id="saving-people"><a class="header" href="#saving-people">Saving People</a></h3>
<p><em>So let the trumpet players play, because I am on the way!</em></p>
<p>Being the hero is oftentimes reward enough to be an agenda worth pursuing. And considering that people tend to <em>like</em> heroes and shower them with favors (both material and sexual), it is by no means an &quot;irrational&quot; life goal. And there is lots of heroing to do in After Sundown. There is a lot of crime, people frequently can't trust the police, and there are secret magical threats that could hurt or kill many people. Trying to save people involves asking big questions. For example, how do you reconcile trying to save people when you or your allies may in fact periodically eat people? It's an <em>answerable</em> question, but it's one you have to ask.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, some of the most effective heroes in the realm of horror <em>don't</em> have a lot of taboos with regards to hurting people, killing fools, and generally being a dick. If you were trying to make some sort of larger point about how it's never okay to bash someone's head open and eat their delicious brains, you wouldn't even <em>be</em> a vampire. You'd go public, hope that humanity would win the immediate war with the supernaturals, and figure it would all be okay at some point. But since you're <em>not</em> doing that (as defined by the fact that you're still playing the game), you're pulling some sort of justification based on the fact that currently the <em>only</em> known ways to actually end Zombie uprisings or meaningfully stop Pod invasions are magic based. So if humanity goes to war with the supernaturals and <em>wins</em> (already at horrendous cost), it also pretty much <em>loses</em>, because the Z-War starts up shortly after that, and there's no guarantees that any humans will survive. So being a hero in After Sundown pretty much means that you've resigned yourself to keeping humans in the dark about actual cannibalistic monsters in their midst to forestall even bigger problems should those beasts be destroyed en masse.</p>
<p>So there we have it: you're a hero in After Sundown and <em>nonetheless</em> you're spending a certain amount of your time covering up brutal monstrous bastards who are actual monsters. That's a difficult head space for a lot of people to get into, but it's probably best to think of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0162065/">Angel</a> or <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119654/">Men In Black</a>. You fight monsters that overstep the lines, but you seriously have monsters on your team. And you <em>help</em> those monsters who aren't going over the line - it encourages them to stay that way.</p>
<p>Characters uninterested in the accolades of saving damsels in distress can oftentimes be persuaded to join in nevertheless. At the big scale it's simply a no-brainer: when Demons want to destroy the world, that <em>is</em> where you keep all your stuff. But even on the small scale there's the fact that threats to human safety are frequently threats to the Vow of Silence (and thus to the very existence of supernatural society). And not a few acts of heroism get <em>rewards</em>. And rewards are a lot like wages except that no one expects them to be <em>taxed</em>, which is good news for anyone living under society's radar.</p>
<p>While a heroic motivation may seem somewhat uncharacteristic for the genre, it's really not. Not only is it factually true that the heroic motivation is the most common motivation of protagonists in source material, but it's also interestingly true that it is the most common motivation of people playing in After Sundown <em>games</em>. Players don't actually get any real power or wealth from the successes of their characters, so it is very understandable when players want to play adventurous and selfless characters - telling a good story and saving the day are as much reward as the <em>player</em> ever gets.</p>
<p>The one place where heroism really falls apart is if one or more players choose to play characters who cannot be reconciled with heroism. This can totally happen, as there is literally nothing in a Vampire's job description that prevents them from being a serial rapist or cannibal or whatever - indeed it takes a fair amount of work on their part to <em>not</em> do that. A fair amount of work that protagonists in stories are very likely to put in, but there are players who don't want to. If one player wants to be a hero and another wants to explore the &quot;dark side&quot; you seriously should not run the campaign at all. It will not go well, and you should save yourself some grief and have one or both players play something else.</p>
<h4 id="a-special-note-on-super-heroes"><a class="header" href="#a-special-note-on-super-heroes">A Special Note on &quot;Super Heroes&quot;</a></h4>
<p>After Sundown source material includes Comic Book Superheroes. Most notably there is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blade_%28comics%29">Blade</a>, but let us not forget that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_League_of_Extraordinary_Gentlemen">League of Extraordinary Gentlemen</a> is a comic as well, or that much of our present day lore on vampires, zombies, and demons comes from the pages of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman">Batman</a>. The superheroic adventure structure is thus familiar territory for an After Sundown game, and superheroic storytelling tropes are familiar territory for such characters and situations. Episodically saving the town/country/planet from the threat of the week or doggedly hunting down the monster of the week is perfectly acceptable as a campaign goal.</p>
<p>The place where &quot;horror&quot; ends and &quot;super heroes&quot; begin is oftentimes not all that clear. Historically, horror comics have waxed and waned in popularity just as heroes in tights have, but they've been around since the beginning. And the overlap has been severe. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swamp_Thing">Swamp Thing</a> has had crossovers with capes and crossovers with conventional slasher fare. There have been numerous iterations of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverine_%28character%29">Wolverine</a> facing zombies or vampires (they are amongst the few things he can use his claws on without getting an M rating). And so on. The point is that if you think of your characters in After Sundown as super heroes who have fangs, this is <em>not</em> a betrayal of source material, it is an affirmation of it.</p>
<p>It might seem like the players would have to be part of a &quot;heroic&quot; organization like the Stellar Oracles to undergo such a campaign arc, but that's completely not the case. The super hero plotline is well preserved in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118276/">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a> (where the Daziban or The Black Hand could easily stand in for the Watcher's Council), <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0162065/">Angel</a> (you can use The Hollow Ones or The Ulmi as fifth season Wolfram &amp; Heart), and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0167190/">Hellboy</a> (you can use the Storm Lords or Ash Walkers as The Agency).</p>
<h3 id="wealth-and-material-comfort"><a class="header" href="#wealth-and-material-comfort">Wealth and Material Comfort</a></h3>
<p><em>...but your blood won't pay my bills / I need money / that's what I want.</em></p>
<p>Mortal society drives us ever faster along the hedonistic treadmill by ever dangling new niceties, new conveniences, and new shows of conspicuous consumption for one to take part in. And the supernatural creatures of the world are not <em>immune</em> to those motivations. Whether from a fear of not having enough pie (as eloquently and disturbingly described by Scarlett O'Hara), a desire to roll around in pie as an exercise of pure id (as demonstrated time and time again by Cookie Monster), a competitive urge to simply <em>have</em> more pie than potential rivals (see almost any antagonist in a Disney venture), or merely the thrill of achievement (Remy from Ratatouille), getting pie is a powerful motivator. Perhaps the most useful factor of this set of character motivations is that it is easily judged and easily incorporated into other goals.</p>
<p>More is rather trivially compared with less, so it is generally rather obvious and <em>easy to predict</em> when a character's actions will be in accordance with the overall goal of getting a Mercedes full of cheerleaders. This means that the MC can easily throw a bone to the character to get them interested in a plot hook (just append &quot;and there's a reward&quot; to any storyline). And perhaps more importantly still, it means that the <em>other players</em> can rather easily make concessions to such a character's motivations when they are crafting player-generated plots. All they have to do is add &quot;Step Three: Profit&quot; or &quot;And you can do whatever you want with your share&quot; to whatever the plan was going to be and the wealth-motivated character is &quot;in&quot;.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="jobs-missions-and-quests"><a class="header" href="#jobs-missions-and-quests">Jobs, Missions, and Quests</a></h2>
<p><em>We're here to see a man about a thing. He'll know what it's about.</em></p>
<p>One of the motifs that works best for getting a group of diverse characters to work together in a single story is to introduce the story element of a <em>job</em>. A complex, difficult, or merely remote task that several characters are contracted to perform. This gives things clear direction and bypasses many &quot;what do we do next?&quot; style arguments for as long as the job hasn't been completed yet.</p>
<h3 id="bug-hunt"><a class="header" href="#bug-hunt">Bug Hunt</a></h3>
<p><em>Are we looking at a stand-up fight or a bug hunt?</em></p>
<p>The Bug Hunt is so venerable that indeed it was the <em>assumed</em> mission for Role Playing Games in the 80s. The basic premise is that some area or building is <em>full of monsters</em> and the player characters are wanted to <em>clear them out</em>. Bug Hunts generally at least start out like the beginning of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090605/">Aliens</a> or the end of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092991/">Evil Dead 2</a>, and they can provide a good time to those players whose characters specialize in brutally murdering things they don't like. But they can become more complicated at any time. Were the people who wanted you to clear out the monsters completely honest about the contents? Are there innocents or valuable property that the characters are supposed to protect while taking out the monsters? Are the characters supposed to take one or more of the monsters back alive (or in the case of zombies: <em>animate</em>)? Is there a bigger problem that is creating the monster infestation in the first place, such as a gate to another world or an evil sorcerer?</p>
<p>While the proximal goal of a bug hunt is combat driven, they are great starting points for suspense and character driven role playing. The hunters can become the hunted, and the mission itself may be more than it seems from a number of angles. In After Sundown, it is usually best to use non-playable supernaturals as the nemeses for a bug hunt game: it's kind of weird to be hunting &quot;werewolves&quot; when one of the players may themselves be a werewolf. But the same basic plot structure takes over when taking out a renegade band of vampires that is threatening the Vow of Silence or attempting to conquer the worlds or something.</p>
<h3 id="dungeon-crawl"><a class="header" href="#dungeon-crawl">Dungeon Crawl</a></h3>
<p><em>...say we get into the cage, and through the security doors there and down the elevator we can't move, and past the guards with the guns, and into the vault we can't open...</em></p>
<p>In some sense even older than the Bug Hunt is the Dungeon Crawl, from when default adventure was to go into a dungeon and clear it of everything of value. The difference between a Bug Hunt and Dungeon Crawl is that in the Dungeon Crawl you <em>don't</em> want to fight all the bugs; you're there for something else. In that sense it's like a Reconnaissance mission with a heavy emphasis on stealth, but the character's have goal other than violence, which could be a MacGuffin or just a general suspicion that there are valuable things that would prefer to be in their possession. What distinguishes a Dungeon Crawl proper from another sort of mission is that the <em>place</em> is the focus of the action; the mission is site-based in it's goal in a way that other missions, which could range anywhere depending on where the opposing forces involved choose to go, are not.</p>
<p>Probably the most iconic Dungeon Crawl in all of horror takes place in the warrens beneath the Wing Kong Holdings warehouse in <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090728/">Big Trouble in Little China</a>. Things get much more weird and complicated than anything that Jack and Wang Chi expected to find and they have to pick their battles with guards and keep alerts from getting out of hand, and getting out is just as much of an adventure as getting in. In After Sundown some of the dungeons aren't on Earth and there's pretty much no limit to how strange they can be or what wonders they may hold.</p>
<h3 id="courier-run"><a class="header" href="#courier-run">Courier Run</a></h3>
<p><em>I need this to be delivered to Mount Doom.</em></p>
<p>The Courier Run is at its core merely an obstacle course. The characters are asked to go from where they are to somewhere else, possibly by way of a series of intermediary locations, possibly any way they want to. The catch of course is that the characters are intended to take a MacGuffin with them. Maybe it's a valuable painting, or a secret letter to a Covenant Bishop. Sometimes it's even alive or otherwise hard to transport. Maybe it's a Mantrap being taken in for study, or a suitcase with a woman in it. Save for the fact that some MacGuffins are physically harder to move without attracting attention than others, it doesn't much matter.</p>
<p>The key to the mission, and the reason it's the foundation of some of Western literature's greatest works, is that there is no real limit to how much stuff can be &quot;in the way&quot;. Burdened as the player characters are with whatever the MacGuffin is, it is generally not unreasonable that enemies who don't want the MacGuffin delivered can get ahead of the PCs again and again. Nor is it unreasonable that there would be obstacles and enemies already there along any particular route the player characters choose to take. We're looking at classic works like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odyssey">The Odyssey</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings">Lord of the Rings</a> as well as contemporary works like <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0293662/">The Transporter</a>.</p>
<h3 id="fetch-quest"><a class="header" href="#fetch-quest">Fetch Quest</a></h3>
<p><em>Lots of things are valuable, but there's no replacement for this.</em></p>
<p>The Fetch Quest is a time honored time waster in which the player characters are asked to go somewhere, get something, and bring it back. While you will sometimes see this in video games where the players are literally just walking to point B and back, all the memorable ones involve going somewhere that is guarded, dangerous, hidden, or in some other way hard to get stuff out of. Basically, a Fetch Quest is like a Courier Run where you don't even start with the MacGuffin. </p>
<p>Fetch Quests can very easily escalate into Dungeon Crawls if the thing being fetched is under heavy guard or lock-n-key (or both). They can also become Reconnaissance if the actual location of the MacGuffin isn't known. But you're probably going to see a lot of the same kinds of plot twists as a Courier Run - hostile interference, missing MacGuffins, and so on. Remember that in a Fetch Quest, it is very likely that someone wants the MacGuffin to stay where it is, and it is also likely that someone thinks that they have a legitimate claim with the law to enforce that desire. The best kind of Fetch Quest is probably the Heist, where the characters must bring together their own series of Reconnaissance missions to merely have a chance at the Dungeon Crawl and escape, and any mistake could lead to them being the Hunters Hunted.</p>
<h3 id="the-hunters-hunted"><a class="header" href="#the-hunters-hunted">The Hunters Hunted</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;Be the hunter, not the hunted&quot;</em></p>
<p>In horror (and really any fiction involving investigation generally) sometimes a scene happens because the investigator has found out about a bad guy and sometimes a scene happens because the bad guy has found out about the investigation. Think of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093437/">The Lost Boys</a>, where the younger brother in the family is gathering information about the vampires while the vampires are also getting closer to the family through the older brother. Eventually the players either confront the enemy on their turf or let the enemy come to them, and while the later may seem the passive side there is actually a lot of power in being an <em>aware</em> target of an attack. The players essentially have the whole world (and beyond) to be in and can therefor try to shape where the conflict happens to their advantage, depending on what they're willing to risk by leaving it behind.</p>
<p>While it's almost always better for the player characters to be the proactive party it is nonetheless the case that sometimes their enemies will be the ones with the initiative, or at least taking actions largely independent of what the player characters are focused on. In the world of After Sundown this often means a careful dance of two opposed groups trying to avoid each other's attention while maneuvering to compromise the others, but what matters is where they ultimately intersect. One of the important things to keep in mind with the Hunters Hunted is that both the players characters and their opposition are in some sense taking turns, but there is an inherent inequality to the flow of information between the <em>players</em> and the MC. As scenes go by the characters either advance towards the hunters or try to avoid them, or ignore them and let them get closer. So one of the best ways to represent this is with a chain of pairs of alternate scenes, one representing the characters having the initiative and pushing into enemy territory and the other the consequence of failing to do so and having the hunters catch up with them..</p>
<h3 id="reconnaissance"><a class="header" href="#reconnaissance">Reconnaissance</a></h3>
<p><em>In Auto-Recon 2, you get to have a boat.</em></p>
<p>The reconnaissance mission is the simple directive to go to point A or track down person B, find out what's going on, and escape to report about it. This can be a simple stealth, talking, or even research task; or it can be a bit more complicated if that's what is desired. In fact, since the entire point of the job is to find out what's going on, the mission can extremely plausibly turn into any other kind of mission. The player characters are essentially going into a black box mission. They don't know what's going on behind the curtain and then they go behind the curtain and then... anything you want.</p>
<p>A common method of spicing up recon work is to have the characters uncover something that is &quot;time critical&quot; such as a bomb plot, a scheduled human sacrifice, a growing zombie army or something else that the team is encouraged to interfere with immediately upon arrival rather than going back and giving a report. A good example of this is pretty much any of the Indiana Jones movies. Another good trope is to have enemies found during the recon which then come after the player characters. Most haunted house stories operate on roughly this premise, where once the characters get in the new mission becomes escaping with their lives.</p>
<h3 id="rescue-mission"><a class="header" href="#rescue-mission">Rescue Mission</a></h3>
<p><em>Honestly? I don't care what you do or who you do it to. I want to see my daughter again.</em></p>
<p>Rescuing people (and in some cases animals or objects of art) can be one of the clearest objectives available. The thing that the target is being rescued from need not be a hostage situation, sometimes it's just a dangerous situation or even a loveless marriage or exploitive contract. There are plenty of ways to spice or gum up such a scenario. The most obvious of course is by having people who don't want you to rescue the target having more power at their disposal than expected. But you can also have additional groups competing to &quot;rescue&quot; the target or even have the target <em>not want to be rescued</em>. In horror, the person you set out to rescue might even turn out to be a much bigger problem than anything they seem to need to be rescued from.</p>
<p>The best part of a rescue mission from the standpoint of an MC is that it both has a definite end <em>and</em> leaves a clear path for additional stories. Once a target has been rescued (or not) and brought to a safe and agreed upon location (or not), the characters' interest and job is demonstrably over. On the other hand, you've just introduced some NPCs who demonstrably have enemies and the PCs have crossed swords with those enemies. So rescue missions can serve well in <em>either</em> a one shot role or as a stepping stone to further stories.</p>
<p>Remember also that the inherent goal of a rescue mission is to get the target out safely. Thus, while it is often an option to go in guns ablaze, there is legitimately nothing in the job description that would necessitate using physical violence at all. Stealth, social subtleties, and arcane magic can all be highly important in a rescue mission. Indeed, some of the <em>best</em> rescue missions from history involve absolutely no one on either side dying. </p>
<h3 id="wet-work"><a class="header" href="#wet-work">Wet Work</a></h3>
<p><em>The second kill is considerably easier than the first.</em></p>
<p>Sometimes the entire goal of a job is just to straight up murder someone. Sometimes the reasons for doing this are totally noble, and there are a lot of those reasons to go around in After Sundown. Sometimes it's just a purely mercenary deal. Sometimes you get to have a little bit of both. African warlords, Columbian drug bosses, and ancient vampire royalty all often control fairly large amounts of resources, and it is not inconceivable that someone might be willing to pay another person some resources in order to free those resources up, completely aside from their relative worth as moral agents. In particular, monstrous player characters might want to kill someone to consume their power and take it for themselves.</p>
<p>Just walking up to some guy at Pizza Hog and stabbing them in the face isn't much of an <em>adventure</em>, so generally speaking it's best to send the would-be assassins after people who have compounds full of guards, ancient castles filled with magical traps, or undisclosed locations that are possibly in other worlds. The actual act of killing a dude is kind of an anticlimax in that basically you ram something sharp into their chest and they stop moving. So it's advisable for most Wet Work assignments to have the adventure be <em>getting there</em> through secrecy and obstacles rather than the final fight itself. Alternatively, the kill might merely be the <em>beginning</em> of the adventure, as the escape, cover-up, and social consequences may become much bigger problems than a simple murder.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="placing-opposition"><a class="header" href="#placing-opposition">Placing Opposition</a></h2>
<p><em>In the third series, one of the main antagonists is her own daughter from an alternate timeline where she has become evil and resentful. There weren't a lot of things left in the current world that could challenge her after the shenanigans of the second series.</em></p>
<p>The key thing to remember as an MC is that you don't get anything for thwarting the protagonists. While it is generally a good idea to make the progression of the chronicle feel somewhat challenging, there is no special benefit to be had by terminating the chronicle early due to failure or character death. When designing opposition for the player characters, the goal should be to maintain the verisimilitude of the world first, and to provide interesting and exciting challenges to the players second. &quot;Defeating&quot; the players is not a meaningful or acceptable goal for the MC to have.</p>
<p>After Sundown has some seriously terrifying stuff in it, but that doesn't mean that the protagonists have to be challenged by it all the time. Indeed, if the players face nothing but enemies scaled to their abilities, the power of the characters won't ever be apparent. A Werewolf on a rampage in war form is a very scary thing, and a couple of police officers are very unlikely to be able to effectively contain it. Having the players periodically overpower challenges of this sort in a casual manner is good for the game. At the same time, if the protagonists never take on enemies that are near their power level, their adventurers will gradually lose interest.</p>
<p>Players should work with the MC to direct their adventurers in a manner where they come into direct conflict with opposition that is in their ecological niche. The MC should take aims to make the world feel like it is persistent and continues to have events and conflicts while the player characters are not around. This means among other things that the powerful elders in the worlds should be available to be communicated with and opposed. But the MC should frankly discuss political and military realities such that players can pick battles they can win. While the choice between two unmarked doors leading to victory or defeat may be fair, it does not feel fair and it doesn't make an interesting story.</p>
<h3 id="portraying-opposition"><a class="header" href="#portraying-opposition">Portraying Opposition</a></h3>
<h4 id="negotiation"><a class="header" href="#negotiation">Negotiation</a></h4>
<p>It can be hard to negotiate with players in the role of an NPC. Roughly speaking, the goal of the MC in a negotiation with the PCs is to portray NPCs as true to their character as possible. Players should be able to use their own skill in addition to the Powers and skills of their characters to get an advantage over most NPCs. Try to <em>portray</em> opposition to the players actions, but don't get investing in actually resisting them yourself: if they have a good pitch then they should get a good chunk of what they want. Just don't give them the farm for nothing.</p>
<p>Generally, you can't get more out of a skilled negotiator than their BATNA: the Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement. That is, you have to offer them a better deal than they have from just walking away (assuming they can). Of course, not everyone that the players encounter is going to be reasonable or even have understandable goals - Evil Plants just aren't easy to cut deals with.</p>
<p>People want things they don't have, and so there are diminishing returns to offering them more of what they already have plenty of. If you're trying to leverage your Finances 3 to get some Backup, it's a lot easier to buy it off of someone with Finances 1 than someone with Finances 4, because the person with Finances 4 likely wants to keep their backup handy in case they're threatened, but it's a tempting offer to someone with fewer resources.</p>
<p>Some people respond to pressure by freezing up and rejecting the deal, and others crumple and accept. Roughly speaking, if you can overwhelm someone with enough net hits (more than their Logic), then you can get them to agree to most anything, so long as it seems like a plausibly good deal.</p>
<h4 id="fear-and-morale"><a class="header" href="#fear-and-morale">Fear and Morale</a></h4>
<p>One important aspect of After Sundown is that the <em>protagonists</em> are often more horrifying than their opposition. Not only should they occasionally be able to overwhelm enemies with supernatural force, they can also frequently attain victory through pants-shitting terror. Rampaging Werewolves aren't just deadly, they induce panic, and a substantial number of people that encounter it should break and run.</p>
<p>More broadly, considering fear and morale isn't just a matter of portraying the terrifying nature of monstrous protagonists, but it also means ending fights before they dissolve into penalty-induced wuss-slapping or boring clean-up actions. Noncombatants (and undisciplined combatants) should break and run early, but even well-disciplined and competently lead fighting forces will lead ordered retreats when continuing the fight no longer serves their interests.</p>
<p>When in doubt, have any Extras make a Social Resistance Test against a threshold based on a combination of how terrifying the opposition is and what losses they have already take and either flee in terror or attempt to surrender if they fail. For well organized groups instead have their leader make a Willpower + Tactics test against the same (or lesser) threshold. Organized fighters will generally attempt to make an orderly retreat before offering surrender or breaking into a rout.</p>
<h4 id="combat-tactics"><a class="header" href="#combat-tactics">Combat Tactics</a></h4>
<p>Roughly, characters without the Tactics skill don't tend to make smart tactical choices. Even more importantly, groups without recognized leaders that have a decent Tactics skill are usually not going to be very good at coordinated actions. They aren't going to try to focus their attacks on a single target to overwhelm their defenses, they don't make organized retreats, they don't use covering fire for defensive advantage, and they break and run individually rather than making an orderly retreat and attempting to save their wounded. Well-lead groups will do all of the above. Don't be afraid to shift your own tactical approach to combat based on the skill of the characters that are involved; some variation will both make the game more interesting and improve the verisimilitude of the world and that includes having the players face incompetent opposition from time to time.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you can sometimes tip the scale when the opposition is highly sophisticated. Skilled tacticians will insure they have lines of retreat so they can live to fight another day and will only press the attack when they have the advantage, leaning on ambushes and overwhelming force to threaten the player characters. Just be careful to make sure your goal is to <em>challenge</em> them, not to make them suffer automatic defeat. Even great tacticians make blunders and it's okay for the players to win decisively if they make smart moves and get lucky. Even if they do poorly, smart attackers may give them the chance to surrender or negotiate an end to hostilities if they have achieved a superior bargaining position and the players are willing to deal.</p>

<p>After Sundown is released with maximal permission given to you to do whatever you want with it. Just as the author of this edition has made extensive changes you are in turn empowered to make any edits, revisions, cuts, or additions you care to, not that the law would have ever stopped anyone from playing differently at their own table anyway; we're just clear that you can publish too and we won't get in your way. All that said, here's some thoughts on making further changes to the game that we hope serve you as you consider making your own mark.</p>
<h3 id="thou-shalt-not-fuck-with-the-target-number"><a class="header" href="#thou-shalt-not-fuck-with-the-target-number">Thou Shalt Not Fuck With the Target Number</a></h3>
<p>The dice rolled in After Sundown <em>always</em> have exactly a 1-in-3 chance of coming up a hit, and so the expected value of a test in hits is always the dicepool divided by 3. The 1-in-3 result makes it tractable at all to intuit a rough chance of success compared to games based on dicepools with variable target numbers or weird dice tricks like exploding 6s or re-rolling 1s. If you mess with this at all you are making an entirely different game. You're more than welcome to take this open-source game and make whatever you want with it, just be aware that nothing will make sense anymore until you personally go in and fix all of it.</p>
<h3 id="critical-failures"><a class="header" href="#critical-failures">Critical Failures</a></h3>
<p>Many other games with dicepool mechanics have a catch where rolling a bunch of 1s (or at least one 1 and no hits) creates complications or straight up negative consequences for the player rolling the dice. This is a really cool idea, but the problem is it's really hard to design such a rule without making it more likely for someone that is <em>better</em> at something (and therefore has more dice) from getting these critical failures or complications more often than someone that doesn't know what they're doing. This goes against the expectation that additional skill and talent should not only give you a greater possible degree of success, but should make you <em>more reliable</em> at doing the things you're good at.</p>
<p>A possible option would be to add one or more stress dice of a different color when defaulting on a skill or otherwise subject to a penalty instead of reducing the die pool, and to then treat hits on the stress die as going towards adding complications to the scene. This is not a standard rule because it doesn't seem worth the effort, but if it's the sort of thing your group is into give it a shot and let us know how it goes.</p>
<h2 id="creating-additional-content"><a class="header" href="#creating-additional-content">Creating Additional Content</a></h2>
<h2 id="adding-powers-to-disciplines"><a class="header" href="#adding-powers-to-disciplines">Adding Powers to Disciplines</a></h2>
<p><em>&quot;Didn't think I could do that, did ya?&quot;</em></p>
<p>There is no special rule that each Discipline has to exactly the number of Basic and Advanced powers it does. And indeed most disciplines have grown since the first edition of After Sundown. Future material may well come with alternate abilities for characters to have instead of the normal features of Powers. Or, as a player or MC could write some of your own.</p>
<p>Adding new abilities to Disciplines can be a cool way to spice things up. But it can also dilute the setting, and make characters more powerful. All things being equal, the larger a number of abilities a player has to sort through, the more work it is going to be and the more powerful a result they are likely to get by cherry picking the right combination of abilities. </p>
<p>Each Discipline should express a common theme among it's powers and have related dicepools that (hopefully) relate to the expression of that unifying idea. New abilities should probably not use radically different dicepools than other powers in the same Discipline, because otherwise you are going to be moving towards a world where someone can max one attribute and one skill and get a very high dicepool in a wide variety of different powers. Similarly, a new ability should not do something radically different from other abilities in the same Discipline.</p>
<p>But above and beyond the simple balance issues that arise from increasing the set size of potential abilities, there's also the concept of setting strain to worry about. There is, for example, no ability that currently allows a character to travel to the dark side of the moon. And while there's nothing inherently overpowered about collecting moon rocks or building a secret base there, it would still take game in a very different direction. So long as there's no way to get to Luna, the moon is outside the playspace entirely, and players do not have to discuss their enemies having gone to the moon - nor do they have to obtain powers to potentially go there. One of the primary things that make games fall apart is the simple proliferation of other places that all need their own powers to reach. If one were to add the distant planet of the Pods, the mythical homeland of the Demons, and a few garden variety Alternate Earths, the game would become very cluttered and confusing.</p>
<h4 id="adding-new-disciplines"><a class="header" href="#adding-new-disciplines">Adding New Disciplines</a></h4>
<p><em>&quot;I have mastered the art of Obscurica, and I can do things you doubtlessly think are impossible.&quot;</em></p>
<p>New Disciplines should not be created without essentially publishing your own variation on the rules. It's not that you can't make a new Discipline that is balanced, because you totally can. It's that new Disciplines undermine the foundation of the game as a shared storytelling medium. The coherency of the world comes apart a little bit every time a new Discipline is introduced. At the limit of adding infinite Disciplines, no action that any character takes with magic has any context - even if none of the new Disciplines is substantially over powered or deceptively worthless, the game still becomes essentially unplayable. </p>
<p>However, a 23rd Discipline is not the same thing as the 101st Discipline, and the conceptual coverage of the magical disciplines in After Sundown is essentially arbitrary. It's entirely possible to add a new Discipline or two without breaking anything, and indeed the second edition has 3 more than the first. But remember: it is a slippery slope and you seriously can't just keep adding new Disciplines forever without breaking the world. Don't be afraid to put your foot down. Just because you let one player bring a new Discipline into the game and it would be &quot;fair&quot; to allow another player the same opportunity doesn't mean that placing more straw on your camel is a good idea.</p>
<p>If you are going to make a new Discipline, keep some things in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Disciplines are always Universal, Astral, Infernal, or Orphic. You may think you have a cool idea for some fourth power source, but dowsing and dispelling for 3 flavors of magic is already hard to keep track of. A fourth power source means that monster hunters will have a whole new set of equipment in addition to all the crap they have to carry around with themselves. And you'll want to make at least a half-dozen different new Disciplines to flesh out that power source, which is a huge job and will almost inevitably start stepping on the otes of the original Otherwordly themes.</li>
<li>A new Discipline should have at least 2 Basic, 2 Advanced, and one example Elder power in it. If you can't think of that many powers for it, you should seriously consider the idea that you don't yet have a Discipline worth writing up or disturbing the status quo for.</li>
<li>You already have a set of a powers that you can draw upon for ideas in the form of the Disciplines already printed. If you have a Basic Ability in a Discipline, go ahead and compare it to the Basic Abilities of Discipline already printed. That being said, the levels of power aren't always that distinct and criticism of the balance of different powers is always useful.</li>
<li>Each new Discipline will be taken by probably one character at most in your game. You should make sure that the dicepool choices for the abilities are pretty static through the whole writeup.</li>
<li>Discipline that are collections of heterogeneous abilities are, in general, hard to keep track of and you shouldn't make them. It might be tempting to make a Discipline that is simply the list of abilities displayed by some sorcerer in a book you liked, but such &quot;stuff from the attic&quot; powers confuse players. A new Discipline should, if anything, be more clearly themed than one of the ones in the basic book - the players won't have it in the book to go back to so it needs to be more memorable on its own merits.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="adding-more-playable-monsters"><a class="header" href="#adding-more-playable-monsters">Adding More Playable Monsters</a></h4>
<p><em>TK</em></p>
<p>It's really not that hard to write up a coherent description and power set for additional monsters. It's just that they won't fit into the setting because everyone already expects that all vampires are effectively one of three varieties. You can totally do it, but again you are probably taking on a bigger project than you think; if you aren't willing to fully edit and republish the setting material in After Sundown to incorporate your new monsters they aren't ever really going to fit in the way that Frankensteins and Strigoi do, and maybe not even then because the existing cast of supernatural horrors has already been quite deliberately cherry-picked from the best pop culture has to offer.</p>
<p>If you are going to add additional subtypes here is some general advice:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's easier to fit in additional Outliers than other types, because Outliers are already on the edges of supernatural society and there isn't any other coherent theme to what makes an Outlier. If you want a playable Ghost that's quite easy to squeeze that in as an Outlier because there are already ghosts around in the setting and it's quite believable that some of them have social status with Cults and Syndicates.</li>
<li>Every subtype should have a single power source (either Astral, Infernal, or Orphic) and power schedule.</li>
<li>Every subtype should have one of the three common vulnerabilities and weaknesses already present in other monsters; folks are already having to deal with 12 different things in their magic monster hunting kits and expanding that get ridiculous really quickly.</li>
<li>Each subtype should have a Distinctive Flaw that is, as much as possible, <em>distinct</em> from other monsters to help set them apart.</li>
<li>The subtype should have a core set of 6 Basic and 2 Advanced starting powers that relate to their theme, and those powers should have some substantial overlap in the Attributes and Skills that they employ or otherwise interact with, because the subtypes are a sort of &quot;soft class&quot; and making them too narrow or too spread out is a subtle way of putting them out of balance with other starting In Medias Res characters. That said, any power that contributes to a character's physical combat capabilities is going to synergize pretty well with the others, so that's a bit of an exception, but don't go overboard with those either.</li>
</ul>
<p>Particular types have their own rules as well:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lycanthropes are always on a Lunar power schedule and have a starting Protean power that changes their entire body.</li>
<li>Vampires are always on a Feeding power schedule and have a starting power that reflects their method of feeding in addition to The Blood Is The Life (how Vampires become Vampires) and their &quot;hard to kill&quot; combo of Patience of the Mountains, Revive the Flesh and Restoration, which already takes up more than half the available starting powers.</li>
<li>Witches are already a &quot;Steve&quot; type, meaning you can do about anything you want with them, and don't really need or justify additional subtypes - a &quot;School&quot; sub-sub-type is usually a better option.</li>
<li>Leviathan always have Patience of the Mountains to represent their immortality and a Basic and Advanced Discernment power to represent their deeper connection to the esoteric parts of the monstrous condition.</li>
<li>Animates always have a Ritual power schedule and start with Patience of the Mountains and either Restoration or Grotesque Aegis (the later as a <em>Mutation</em>) to represent the artificial nature of their creation. The trick with new Animates is to find a type of interpersonal relationship failure that <em>isn't</em> just &quot;friendless&quot;, because the core idea of the game is that you have a Band of friends that you're going on adventures with.</li>
<li>Transhumans are already an odd grouping and don't really have much in common outside of some thematic ideas. It's usually better to create another Outlier than to overload the strain on Transhumans.</li>
</ul>
<p>Adding additional broad types is even harder because you need at least three subtypes, one from each power source. If you don't have three ideas with legs for a new type you probably aren't ready to add another broad category of monster. Try starting with a new Outlier and see if you still want to expand on it after that.</p>
<h4 id="adding-more-non-playable-monsters"><a class="header" href="#adding-more-non-playable-monsters">Adding More Non-Playable Monsters</a></h4>
<p><em>&quot;TK&quot;</em></p>
<p>Adding more antagonists that live in the Otherworlds is a much less risky proposition. Before doing so you should probably consider that the existing Otherworldly monsters are just starting points and you can expand them easily into new prototypes you can re-use to create incrementally more powerful antagonists while still leaving them recognizable in relation to the broader category that is their type. Just adding new powers to a Wraith is perfectly acceptable within rules of the game and even expected, and there is no reason the players shouldn't expect that there are handfuls of Wraiths that have formed Bands just like them and survived long enough to gain further powers.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Otherworlds are meant to be, after all, entire worlds each the size of the Earth or larger and much less well explored. There is a lot of territory open in them for additional threats if you have good ideas for them. Let us know what you come up with.</p>
<p>Here are the guidelines for new non-playable monsters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every type should have a single Otherworldly power source.</li>
<li>Every subtype should have a single power schedule.</li>
<li>Every type should have one of the existing vulnerabilities and weaknesses.</li>
</ul>

Most don't carry weapons and are in fact forbidden from doing so while on the job, but they probably know where the first aid kits are kept at least. Poor pay means they are often susceptible to bribes, and they tend to have pretty good practical knowledge of the particular security systems and procedures at the places they work, so paying them off is pretty useful. More competent security officers have qualifications (and equipment) similar to patrol officers or detectives because many of them are in fact patrol officers or detectives doing private security work as a second job.

<h4 id="average-shambler"><a class="header" href="#average-shambler">Average Shambler</a></h4>
<p>An Extra transformed into a Shambler isn't much of a threat on their own. Even with increased Strength, their lack of skills keep their dicepools low in combat. Shambler's might try to beat someone down with fists if ordered, but classically they try to grab and then bite targets, which the human jaw isn't particularly great at.</p>

<p>The standard non-Luminary killer robot benefits from being built of metal and having Strength beyond what a human is capable of, but isn't much better than a Shambler tactically. On the other hand they can both soak up and deal a lot of damage, and Nimble Feet means they are terribly difficult to run away from. Several example weapons are listed but most Automata will only have one or two and they will generally employ the Spray-n-Pray option with their ranged weapons.</p>
<p>Automata are effectively subject to Emptiness. The listed Strength includes the passive Vigor that is lost if they are weakened by alcohol.</p>

<p>N.B. Unlike the Glossary, which lists game terms as used by <em>players</em>, this Lexicon is intended for use in-character by the subjects of the game.</p>
<p>Baby
: <em>slang</em> a newly transformed monster. Usually compounded with mildly offensive epithets, e.g. &quot;baby-bat&quot; for newly risen Camazotz.</p>
<p>Band
: a small group of Monsters that share personal bonds of loyalty; a sort of chosen family of the supernatural.</p>
<p>Bloodbag
: <em>slang</em> a mortal with an interest - usually sexual - in being fed on by Vampires or other blood-drinking monsters. By extension, any mortal that is easy for monsters to feed on.</p>
<p>Bumin Hoarde, The
: a former Syndicate destroyed and absorbed by the Cauchemar Communes. Remains only as TK cult.</p>
<p>Cauchemar
: <em>Communes</em> from the French for nightmare; the Monsters of the Cauchemar Communes, or by extension the members of any Syndicate or the type that could be. See <em>Kin</em></p>
<p>Cauchemar Communes
: the youngest extant syndicate. Organized as a permanent revolution. Their expansion has generally followed the socialist diaspora out of Europe, giving them power in Northern Europe, the American Midwest, and much of inland Russia and China.</p>
<p>Communes, The
: see <em>Cauchemar Communes</em>.</p>
<p>Covenant, The
: a syndicate dating back to the early medieval era. Organized as a parody of the hierarchy of the Catholic Church. Holds power in much the same territory as the church it reflects, including much of Southern Europe, Central America, and South America.</p>
<p>Crowley
: <em>slang</em> a mortal with an exploitable interest in the occult.</p>
<p>Cult
: a supernatural organization that has some occult purpose. Generally bigger than a Band and smaller than a Syndicate.</p>
<p>Damned, the
: <em>Covenant</em> the sort of monsters accepted into the Covenant; by extension, the members of any Syndicate. See <em>Kin</em></p>
<p>Elder
: a Monster that has developed greater Potency and unique powers, either by surviving as a Monster for longer than a human lifetime or stealing it (see Titaning).</p>
<p>False Face, The
: a former Syndicate now reduced to the status of a cult. Previously extended throughout the Americas. Notable due to the fact that wars between the False Face and the Covenant lead to the modern peace between the Syndicates.</p>
<p>Fam
: <em>slang</em> the sort of monsters that are generally accepted by the Syndicates. Adopted from the LGBTQ community. See <em>Kin</em>.
: <em>slang</em> a Monster's closest associates. See <em>Band</em>.</p>
<p>Going Loud
: <em>slang</em> using magic that would break the Vow of Silence if mortals witnessed it. Most commonly used to refer to situations where this isn't a problem, such as in the Otherworlds.</p>
<p>Harker
: <em>slang</em> a mortal employed by a monster as a cut-out or intermediary to interact with mortal society on their behalf. Specialists exist for setting people up with arms-length Harkers hidden within webs of shell corporations.</p>
<p>Kin, Kinfolk
: <em>Makzen</em> the common English translation of the Persian &quot;دوستان ما&quot;; members of the Makhzen.
: <em>Makzen</em> the sort of Monsters considered for membership in the Makhzen and other Syndicates: Animates, Leviathan, Lycanthropes, Transhumans, Vampires, Witches, and sometimes the Outliers.</p>
<p>Lab
: <em>slang</em> a private place where monsters can meet, feed, or perform rituals without being disturbed by mortals.</p>
<p>League, The
: see <em>World Crime League</em></p>
<p>Helsing
: <em>slang</em> a monster hunter with enough real knowledge of the supernatural to be dangerous, either physically or (more importantly) because they might create publicity and endanger the Vow of Silence. Syndicates usually eliminate Helsings, but sometimes they are recruited or employed against their enemies.</p>
<p>Makzen, The
: the oldest of the extant Syndicates, supposedly dating to the 800s BCE in Persia. Organized as an alliance of independent city-states. Still powerful along much of the Silk Road, Africa, and the American South.</p>

<p>Our Friends
: <em>WCL</em> English translation from the Vietnamese &quot;bạn bè của chúng ta&quot;; members of the World Crime League. By extension, members of any Syndicate or the sort accepted for membership. See <em>Kin</em></p>
<p>Quickening
: <em>slang</em> a more modern term for <em>Titaning</em>. Taken from the &quot;Highlander&quot; franchise.</p>
<p>Renfield
: <em>slang</em> a mortal slave of a Monster. Syndicate justice generally considers a Monster to be responsible for the actions of their Renfields, which in turn means that most of them are kept on a very short leash by magical means.</p>
<p>Syndicate
: one of the global conspiracies of Monsters that make up the backbone of supernatural society. The four Syndicates that exist in the modern era are the Makhzen, the Covenant, the World Crime League, and the Cauchemar Communes. The otherworldly Marduk Society, Shattered Empire, and King with Three Shadows are sometimes lumped in but are not considered Syndicates proper.</p>
<p>Titaning
: gaining personal power by killing Monsters and (usually) eating them, especially when applied to Elders. See <em>Quickening</em>.</p>
<p>Vow of Silence
: the most important rule upheld by all of the Syndicates: you do not tell mortals about the supernatural. Violations of the Vow of Silence potentially carry the death penalty in most every part of monstrous society.</p>
<p>World Crime League, The
: a Syndicate that split off from the Makhzen after the Mongol invasions into Southern Asia. Organized as a pirate council. Holds territory around most of the Pacific Rim and Indian Ocean.</p>
