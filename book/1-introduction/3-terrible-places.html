<p><em>&quot;When you say 'the world' do you mean 'Earth', or 'where we are now'?&quot;</em></p>
<p>After Sundown takes place in a world with many similarities to our own. A world which has the same countries and cities as the ones we are familiar with, and which is therefore one which you can research by reading about actual places in history and physical space. But it is also secretly full of magic and evil and beasts and slashers from horror fiction. It also has connections to three coterminous magic worlds full of monsters and danger.</p>
<p>It is in short: a game that takes place in the realm of horror rather than the realm of the real. You're playing a cooperative storytelling game, and the genre is horror. It may be action-horror, horror-mystery, horror-comedy, or even horror-romance, but it is always horror.</p>
<h2 id="a-life-in-horror-the-good-and-the-bad"><a class="header" href="#a-life-in-horror-the-good-and-the-bad">A Life in Horror: The Good and The Bad</a></h2>
<p><em>&quot;Interesting fact: The Final Girl trope emerged shortly after young women became a major component of horror movie attendees.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Life for the common man in After Sundown is actually pretty horrible, and extremely dangerous. Life in After Sundown is life in a horror movie. Or rather, it is a world not unlike Earth would be if all the horror movies were real in different places and at different times. This means that body counts are extremely high, and it is very difficult to get help. This is good news if you happen to be the Bogie Man, but really bad for anyone looking for a life of vaguely normal properties. Here are some important things to remember:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Police are no help at all.</strong> Heavily infiltrated by cultists and secret societies, the police in After Sundown are astoundingly ineffective. Sure they will <em>occasionally</em> bring down a killer, but the vast majority of crimes go unsolved. Many crimes don't even get investigated, especially if something supernatural is afoot. Official records and evidence disappear all the time and not much is said or even noticed about it. Crime in general is more comparable to the 1970s than to contemporary times.</li>
<li><strong>Telecommunications are Shoddy.</strong> Sat Phones aren't generally reliable in the realm of horror. Cellphone coverage cuts out constantly at inopportune moments. Most people still have landlines, but regular telecommunication wires go down frequently and are out for days at a time. The inability to get a call out of a building or town isn't unusual, that kind of thing happens a lot in After Sundown. Even with a solid connection things on the Internet are likely to be lost, forgotten, or just unavailable even more often in the real world</li>
<li><strong>People Don't Travel Much.</strong> It's not <em>weird</em> for people to not know what goes on in the next town over in After Sundown. Things are just more dangerous, and people keep to themselves more. International travel and vacations may still happen, but people are even more likely to stick to tourist areas and no one is surprised when people that wander off the path aren't seen again.</li>
<li><strong>More People Just Vanish</strong> In the real United States, each year about 2700 people go missing and are never found (besides hundreds of thousands that do turn up). With all the people becoming or being eaten by monsters, the world of After Sundown averages at least twice that, and without much notice - after all, doubling the rate in the lower 48 doesn't even come close to the rate in the real Alaska, and the police seriously don't want to look any harder.</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep this in mind when you're planning your nights in the realm of horror. Life is cheaper and less connected to other life in the realm of horror and it is <em>much</em> easier for dangerous elements to thrive in such an environment.</p>
<p>That being said, it is important to remember that most horror movies begin with people thinking things are pretty normal, and <em>end</em> with something of a return to normalcy as well (or do they?) So it's not like Jason is running around the streets murdering people left and right. Indeed, while the death rate from serial and mass murder may seem to be large enough in the realm of horror to compete with traffic accidents or opiate abuse, even then,
the fact is that you're still more likely to die from cancer. Supernatural creatures remain hidden and the president of the United States is openly a mundane human. A vampire can't just flash their fangs to get free entry to a movie theater, and indeed they could be in a lot of trouble if they flash their fangs in a public space of any kind.</p>
<h2 id="the-four-worlds"><a class="header" href="#the-four-worlds">The Four Worlds</a></h2>
<p><em>&quot;Things are crawling in all over the place these days.&quot;</em></p>
<p>A very common trope in horror is the inclusion of additional worlds that are full of terror and danger. This is very useful since of course having an extra world around allows you to fit things into the narrative that would be otherwise very difficult to fit into the Earth. Demon armies, forgotten cities, and strange and deadly plants can be piled to the sky and beyond without otherwise upsetting the world provided that they were never in the world in the first place. Furthermore, the idea that monsters can come in sideways is by itself a wonderfully useful notion for the horror genre, because it severely undermines the concept of safety in a fortress or locked room. It also provides places for the supernatural - players and their antagonists in particular - to really cut loose in a way that would draw undue attention in normal society.</p>
<p>That being said, it is also true that there are a lot of alternate worlds to be had in various stories. Too <em>many</em> alternate worlds to be anything vaguely approaching something workable. And so it is that as a compromise we have cut things down to three alternate realities:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Earth: The Mortal World</strong> This is the world where most people live. It's just like our world except magic and monsters are real. And it's connected to the three other worlds. It is portrayed in virtually every horror movie because it <em>is</em> the world of every horror movie.</li>
<li><strong>Limbo: The Dark Reflection</strong> The best rendition of the Dark Reflection is probably in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0384537/">Silent Hill</a>, although the Hell of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0360486/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1">Constantine</a> is also apt. It's a world very much like our own but scoured with demonic powers. Ash falls from the sky like rain and everything looks abandoned or scorched. Demons prowl the Dark Reflection.</li>
<li><strong>Maya: The Dreamlands</strong> Think of a combination of the untamed and deadly dreamworlds of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113497/">Jumanji</a> or <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0386117/">Where the Wild Things Are</a>. This is where dreams and wild things go, but since this is the realm of horror the dreams are often as not inspired by Freddy and the beasts are likely to be deadly and destructive monsters.</li>
<li><strong>Mictlan: The Gloom</strong> The best rendition of the Gloom is of course in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0403358/">Night Watch</a>, which even calls it that. It's a cold and oppressive world where darkness presses insistently upon the light and heat of travelers. Powers of death leak in from every crevice and extinguish fires and the lives of small animals. Blood hungering insects and ghosts scour the Gloom.</li>
</ul>
<p>Collectively, these alternative supernatural places are called the Otherworlds. Gates pass among them, and each of the supernatural worlds can bleed into the mortal world. In short, like in <em>Silent Hill</em>, it is possible to straddle the worlds where you can still open and close the door of your house and see what's on the stove but demons from the Dark Reflection can attack you. It's also possible to be all the way in the Dark Reflection, where things are a terrifying hellscape and nothing makes any sense. While in a Bleed of any of the worlds, the celestial realities of Earth appear to hold sway - the Sun rises and sets while wind and rain appear on schedule. Fully in the other world it becomes apparent that one is quite likely <em>not on Earth</em>, as the sky itself betrays one to be on an alien rock.</p>
<p>These worlds are more than just places; for supernatural beings they are sources of power. Most of the <em>playable</em> monsters come in a subtype for each power source. In addition, each world hosts it's own native monsters. Further power flows from each world and is codified into the Disciplines for each source.</p>
<h3 id="shallows"><a class="header" href="#shallows">Shallows</a></h3>
<p>The four worlds are mostly coextensive, with something like continents, oceans, and other coarse geography in more-or-less similar locations, for reasons that are often speculated upon but have few satisfying or reliable answers. Human geography is a little more complicated, but often follows somewhat predictable patterns. For example, from a theater in Chicago, a sorcerer might be able to glimpse the remains of a burned building in the window's reflections, dream of a living skyscraper hiding a tiny group of Jalus, or conjure the ghosts of those that died in the back alley.</p>
<p>Normally, a character in the mortal world is safe from attack from things actually in the other worlds and cannot be physically affected by them. Normal people cannot perceive or touch things in other worlds while they are in the Mortal World. Some disciplines allow characters to perceive, or even reach into, things that actually in the parallel parts of other worlds. So for example, if your character has Necromancy, they can perceive goings-on in the Gloom, but they are still safe from physically being harmed by creatures or objects there. When a character moves completely from one world to another, they come out in the nearest place that they can fit, which in some cases will be several meters away from their relative location in the original world. The character will appear to be hallucinating to observers from either world (who aren't also subject to the same power) because there are things (most especially creatures) that are in only one world and not the other.</p>
<h3 id="depths"><a class="header" href="#depths">Depths</a></h3>
<p>One complication of all of the Otherworlds is that their are more directions present than on Earth. In addition to moving about in three dimensions one can move nearer or farther from the Earth. The places that do not directly correspond to a place in the Mortal World or its past are collectively referred to as the <em>Depths</em>, places farther away from Earth in nature as well as distance. The strangest and most powerful inhabitants of the other worlds tend to dwell or at least arise in these places.</p>
<p>Due to this extra and largely imperceptible aspect of the Otherworlds navigation is considerably more difficult and dangerous than in the Mortal World. Trying to navigate through the Dark Reflection between two Earthly mirrors might put one on a much shorter or longer path than on Earth or lead to different places altogether.</p>
<h3 id="bleeds"><a class="header" href="#bleeds">Bleeds</a></h3>
<p>There are places where the worlds merge, where a character is literally in two worlds because the ground itself is in two worlds. The experience of this is no different than being in just one world at a time because in such places there is only one table in the room. And while said table may be in the style of an Earthly table or a table of Limbo, it will still be a single solid object. Where things get weird is at the edges of the Bleed, where a character inside may see two different outsides. Bleeds oscillate between sending those who leave to one world or the other. Sometimes this is very simple (such as opening a door onto either a blighted hellscape or a normal suburban street), and sometimes it's just plain hard to figure out (such as the difference between a foggy forest and a foggy forest that happens to be in Maya). Bleeds are often temporary or come and go with strange patterns in time.</p>
<h3 id="gateways"><a class="header" href="#gateways">Gateways</a></h3>
<p>TK</p>
<ul>
<li>Limbo: Burnt Rents, Mirror Gates</li>
<li>Maya: Moon Gates (or Faerie Rings?), Dream Tears</li>
<li>Mictlan: Wells, Shadow Gates</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="limbo-the-dark-reflection"><a class="header" href="#limbo-the-dark-reflection">Limbo: The Dark Reflection</a></h2>
<p><em>&quot;You can go to hell!&quot;<br />
&quot;We can't. Not alone...&quot;</em></p>
<p>A long time ago, some people fucked up really bad and parts of the human world started to fall into the fires of The Dark Reflection. Nobody's quite sure exactly when or what - some say that it was the cinders of the atomic fires of Oklo, while others say it is the ancient truth contained in the myth of Prometheus and the Scriptural references to Gehenna; some that men merely opened the doorway into the world of ashes; others say that it was men that started the unquenchable fire that begat The Dark Reflection.</p>
<p>Practically everything found in Limbo was first wrought by humans, and then destroyed by fire. Everywhere in the Dark Reflection there are always remnants of human habitation, and everywhere in the dark reflection, there are always smoke and ashes. Yet it is exceedingly rare to encounter men still living nor open flames still burning. The ground is littered with sooty broken glass: smashed bottles, shattered windows, and  shards of obsidian lie on every surface. The dusty surfaces seem dull, and rarely cast a reflection. When they do, they seem more of a window back to the mortal realm, a cruel reminder of where the onlooker is and where they could be. The sky is perpetually obscured by oppressive smoke and rain falls only infrequently (in many places less than once a year) and it is black with ash when it lands.</p>
<p>The Dark Reflection knows neither day nor night, and languishes eternally in a twilight illumination that comes from between one and four vaguely definable lighter patches in the sky that may well be suns or moons. Limbo is home to trapped horrors such as demons, goblins, and hellspawn such as dragons. All of them endeavor merely to survive long enough to escape. Survival is a brutal matter of scavenging amongst the cinders and preying upon the weaker residents. Escape is more difficult, never more than a temporary respite: for each of the dwellers of The Dark Reflection carry the seed of the unquenchable fire within them, and any who escape are doomed to one day start a blaze which will drag another piece of the human world back into The Dark Reflection.</p>
<h2 id="getting-to-the-dark-reflection"><a class="header" href="#getting-to-the-dark-reflection">Getting to the Dark Reflection</a></h2>
<p><em>&quot;Fire doesn't cleanse, it blackens.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Natural passages in and out of the Dark Reflection are almost always through fires or mirrored surfaces, and it is the latter possibility that gives it its name. Sometimes when something is burned, a rend between the mortal world and the Dark Reflection is left in its place. This is most likely to happen when the burnt thing in question was a source of security such as the wall of a family home or school, or a child's blanket. On the other hand, underground coal seam fires seem to be particularly likely to result in long-term recurring bleeds and are carefully but discretely watched by the Syndicates. Once a character has been to the Dark Reflection even once, these portals appear far more commonly in their presence for the rest of their lives. Those who have been to the Dark Reflection often find themselves avoiding mirrors for fear that they will find the profane staring back at them.</p>
<p>Sorcerous means to enter and escape the Dark Reflection can be found in Infernal Sorcery paths. Leaving the Dark Reflection is difficult for magical creatures. Whether traveling by sorcery or through a gateway from Limbo to the Mortal World requires one to make a Resistance Test (Social if attempting to traverse a summoning, Mental if attempting to pass through a mirror gate, or Physical if attempting to navigate a burnt rend in space) with a Threshold equal to their own Potency. Summoning rituals and special gate preparations can add additional bonus dice in addition to allowing for an Escape Test at all. The property of being difficult to leave is called &quot;The Gauntlet,&quot; and it can render the Dark Reflection a near inescapable prison for the very powerful. For example, The King With Three Shadows has a Potency of 10 and suffers from a <em>name binding</em> that further raises his escape threshold to 15. The locations of truly epic firestorms have left certain portals that waive these restrictions for supernatural creatures of a Potency equal to or less than their Rating.</p>
<h3 id="inhabitants-of-limbo"><a class="header" href="#inhabitants-of-limbo">Inhabitants of Limbo</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;It's being invaded by the Otherworld. By a world of someone's nightmarish delusions come to life.&quot;</em></p>
<p>The majority of natives of the Dark Reflection are Goblins and Demons. These beings are generally pretty uncooperative and rarely are on good terms with any of the major Syndicates. Hellspawn are even worse, and have no society to speak of. The King with Three Shadows has a strong presence in Limbo and has substantially more territory than any other there. World War II created copies virtually intact of several cities in Limbo, and many of them are used by one or more supernatural groups as bases of operation. The firestorms of Dresden created a dusty and scorched copy of that place in the Dark Reflection which is even now inhabited by a fringe of the Covenant. The Rape of Nanking left a level 5 portal to a reflection of the city of Nanjing that is mostly used as a smuggling port by the World Crime League. Herculaneum, Pompeii, Hangzhou, London, and Chicago have older copies still used by various groups.</p>
<p>Not everything in Limbo is a supernatural creature. There are some real humans there, and they are sad people. Food is scarce in the Dark Reflection, and the nightmarish imagery is usually enough to drive those who fall into Limbo to madness and depravity. Most become demonic pawns. However, demonic pawn or not, a human has no Potency and can pass through the narrowest of portals. All too often, by the time they reach an egress they are already committed to serving dark lords by kidnapping other humans from the mortal world and then <em>returning</em> to the land of their torment.</p>
<h3 id="things-to-do-in-hell"><a class="header" href="#things-to-do-in-hell">Things to Do in Hell</a></h3>
<p>For those able to overcome the gauntlet, Limbo can be a convenient way to get around. There's little traffic and one could potentially appear from any burn or mirror, things that happen to appear in otherwise terribly secure places. Of course, you have to not be eaten on the way, and those things that can't eat you might follow you instead.</p>
<p>Because so many things that are lost to the mortal world are copied in Limbo in can be attractive to hunters of lost lore and treasure, although few indeed return with what they are looking for.</p>
<h3 id="infernal-magic"><a class="header" href="#infernal-magic">Infernal Magic</a></h3>
<p>The Dark Reflection is a horrible place from which few things escape. But its reach and grasp can be felt far outside the ashen pits of Limbo itself. Infernal Disciplines are those magics that manipulate and harness the taint of that parched landscape and turn them to one's own advantage. Major varieties of the magic of Limbo can call upon corruption, fire, reflections, names, and insects in ways that seem blatantly impossible and terrifying.</p>
<h2 id="maya-the-dreamlands"><a class="header" href="#maya-the-dreamlands">Maya: The Dreamlands</a></h2>
<p><em>&quot;Everybody's got to dream, young girl. If you don't dream, ya go crazy.&quot;<br />
&quot;Go crazy? Don't mind if I do!&quot;</em></p>
<p>The Dreamlands are a wild and inhospitable place filled with fetid jungles and monstrous beasts. Overgrown with dreadful, implacable, and nightmarish life in all world correspondences - even those in the far north and south of the planet (though it still gets wicked cold at extreme latitudes). No one really knows if Maya is a construct of subconscious thought or the manifestation of a distant world that exists independently of our own. What is clear is that Maya is <em>connected</em> to the dreams of the frightened and the suffering. This world seems somewhat unreal even for those who have traveled to it in the flesh, and the native inhabitants are strange and otherworldly even by the standards set by other supernatural creatures.</p>
<p>Maya does not even necessarily have climactic similarities with its Mortal World correspondences. It boasts floating rocks and sideways waterfalls. And monstrous beasts. And psychic plants. And sometimes the jungles are made more of flesh than wood and vines, interspersed with terrifying wonders such as mountains of fused teeth. What buildings exist are chaotic and senseless. There are few reasons for the sane to want to go to Maya even though it is wondrous and beautiful in its alien and unforgiving fashion. The weather is reminiscent of the Yucatan, with dense cloud cover and frequent, driving rain or storms coming almost every day. On those rare times that the night sky is visible, it is clear that the stars above are unfamiliar. The sky boasts no sun or moon, so where precisely the light comes from in the &quot;daytime&quot; is a matter of speculation.</p>
<h3 id="getting-to-maya"><a class="header" href="#getting-to-maya">Getting to Maya</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;If you die in your dreams, you make me a sandwich.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Perhaps the easiest way to get to The Dreamlands is to <em>go to sleep</em>. While not even a small fraction of dreamers are transported across the barrier, it is nonetheless possible for virtually anyone to make the passage while they are sleeping. A dreamer's physical body remains where it is while the consciousness projects into Maya. If the person dies in the Dreamlands, the body dies as well. If the body dies, the dreamer is lost in Maya indefinitely and becomes a Jalus. There are places where the barrier between Maya and the sleeping mind is weaker. Generally speaking, places with horrible <em>personal</em> murders are more conducive to slipping people across into the nightmare realm. Impersonal deaths, such as natural disasters and battles make the barrier more difficult to cross. Some practice strange disciplines of lucid dreaming or take ill-advised drugs to increase their chances of reaching the strange realm. Physical gateways, though rare, also exist. They are always circles of something, and one crosses the boundary by entering and then exiting the circle. Circles of mushrooms or trees are fairly common as gateways go, but theoretically it could be a circle of anything. In any case, these gateways only function when the moon is visible. Sorcerous means of entering the Dreamlands are found in Astral Sorceries.</p>
<h3 id="inhabitants-of-the-dreamlands"><a class="header" href="#inhabitants-of-the-dreamlands">Inhabitants of the Dreamlands</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;We shall build a tower that shall reach to the stars.&quot;</em></p>
<p>The majority of inhabitants of Maya are neither human nor derived from human stock. Massive monsters stalk the lands and even the plants themselves chitter with an otherworldly malevolence. Fae courts order themselves with inhuman pomp and cruelty, trapping mortal slaves in a pointless ritual or Sisyphean tasks. The Evil Plants in Maya speak to travelers only infrequently. Some can speak telepathically, but they mostly choose not to do so, preferring total domination or consumption of humans. The Giant Animals generally simply attempt to devour anything they come across. While delicious (if alien) fruit and clear water are available year-round and in great quantity, The Dreamlands have the least expatriate civilization from the Mortal world of all the other worlds.</p>
<p>Not everything in this dimension is from another world, however. Sometimes tribes of Jalus congregate together. And for reasons , The Marduk Society has been growing an Arcanotower in the Brazil Correspondence for some time. They patrol that area and keep it <em>mostly</em> clear of Giant Animals, but at least some Evil Plants seem to be allowed free reign to enter the trans-dimensional compound.</p>
<h3 id="things-to-do-in-nightmare"><a class="header" href="#things-to-do-in-nightmare">Things to Do in Nightmare</a></h3>
<p>Among the nightmares exist a few true wonders. Things only dreamed of may exist there, not to mention the strangest forms of life that can be studied. Dreamers can also be interrogated with little consequence to reveal sensitive things in the mortal world.</p>
<h3 id="astral-magic"><a class="header" href="#astral-magic">Astral Magic</a></h3>
<p>The mercurial rain of the Deep Maya has an origin that few can even speculate upon. But whether The Dreamlands represent an intrusion of our subconscious minds into the realm of the physical or the intrusion of an alien realm into our sleeping thoughts, the fact remains that it is a source of power that those who delve deeply into its mysteries can tap. Astral Sorceries are spells and powers that tap into that strange reality. Magic from Maya has a tendency to be as untamed and inhuman as the implacable beasts and plants that inhabit it.
Astral powers can variously affect plants, animals, weather, and dreams, often appearing as strange perversions of the natural order.</p>
<h2 id="mictlan-the-gloom"><a class="header" href="#mictlan-the-gloom">Mictlan: The Gloom</a></h2>
<p><em>&quot;Some people believe that when you die there is a wonderful light. As bright as the sun but it doesn't hurt to look into it. All the answers to all the questions you want to know are inside that light. Truth is... there is no light. Only darkness.&quot;</em></p>
<p>The Gloom has been around forever. Some say that it is space itself and the big bang created the human world as a tiny mote within the Gloom, while others say that the Gloom is the force of entropy to which all things shall return in The End. Whatever the case, The Gloom is supernaturally cold and dark. The ground is bare and everything that lives within The Gloom is hungry all of the time. What plants there are lack essential nutrients and sunlight and cannot grow without blood. All the insects are parasitic.</p>
<p>There are no visible stars in the Deep Gloom. There is no sun in the morning, and no glittering lights in the night. There <em>may</em> be a moon in the sky, but since it is as fixedly black as anything else in the sky it's a matter of debate. Rains never fall and the seas are deathly still. But water and other things rise out of the ground at unpredictable times through a process called &quot;welling&quot;. If you want light in Mictlan, you need to bring it yourself, and even then the illumination cast by a lamp or flashlight is disappointing as if the air itself were a voracious shadow.</p>
<p>The Gloom is home to what the unenlightened would call ghosts, wendigos, and zombies. All of them endeavor to draw prey in from the human world where they may drain the blood, life, and warmth from it to feed their insatiable hungers. The true horror is that such victims do not rest in peace, but instead rise driven by the need to recover the blood, life, and warmth that was taken from them - in an ever-growing cycle of futility. Worse still are the hollow things from the depths, that crave such things as they have never known.</p>
<h3 id="getting-to-mictlan"><a class="header" href="#getting-to-mictlan">Getting to Mictlan</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;Have you ever been killed before? I'll be back in a minute.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Portals to The Gloom are called &quot;wells&quot; and each one is filled with darkness. The most effective portals are holes in the ground filled with shadow and water - literal wells. However in some cases a well will appear which is <em>just</em> a hole filled with water <em>or</em> shadow. In addition, pretty much everyone goes to Mictlan just by dying. Upon death, a person becomes a ghost, but in most cases they don't seem to last very long. While some ghosts (especially the ghosts of Luminaries) kick around pretty much indefinitely, this being the realm of horror it seems most likely that ghosts simply unravel and fade into oblivion. The land of the dead is indeed a super depressing place. Sorcerous means of entering The Gloom are found in Orphic magic paths.</p>
<p>While in the  Gloom, all Ghosts are solid, able to be seen and to exert force upon objects. In bleeds and to an even greater extent in the mortal world this is not reliably true. So it is that many Ghosts essentially cannot get anything done in the mortal world even if they escape Mictlan through a Well. So while there is no barrier to exit The Gloom as there is for the Dark Reflection, the primary residents mostly do not leave even when they can.</p>
<h3 id="inhabitants-of-the-gloom"><a class="header" href="#inhabitants-of-the-gloom">Inhabitants of the Gloom</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;It was their hands that built this city of ours, Father. But where do the hands belong in your scheme?&quot;<br />
&quot;In their proper place, the depths.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Soulless bodies sink into Mictlan fairly regularly, whereupon they are animated by the hungry energies of The Gloom and become wandering zombies. The dusty plains of Mictlan are pretty dangerous for travelers because of this. The Gloom has been around for a long time, and walls erected don't seem to crumble in the cold stillness of the land of eternal night. Over the millennia many people have found time to erect buildings and even cities. Many of these structures stand vacant, mute testament to the fact that long ago someone cared enough to build them. However, some are still in use. The Shattered Empire has several such cities, usually corresponding to places where no city or even point of interest stands in the Mortal World. Others are less ambitious, where the Ulmi family has a castle in the Gloom Shadow of Venice.</p>
<p>There does not appear to be any specific fixed limit to how long a Ghost can persist in The Gloom. So even though most last only very short amounts of time, it is entirely possible that any particular historical figure still exists somewhere in Mictlan. Some Ghosts, unhappy with the idea of wandering through a frozen desert for all eternity have taken the time to put up buildings and even societies. The largest such Ancestor City is at about the same place as Beijing.</p>
<h3 id="things-to-do-in-death"><a class="header" href="#things-to-do-in-death">Things to Do in Death</a></h3>
<p>Theoretically, anything known to the dead might be found in Mictlan, but good luck finding those that know it. Past relics, monuments, and grave goods persist here and there, and in the depths are things that might have been but were never born.</p>
<h3 id="orphic-magic"><a class="header" href="#orphic-magic">Orphic Magic</a></h3>
<p>The Gloom provides power that is dark, timeless, destructive, and very frightening to the living. And for good reason, it truly does act as a window into one's mortality. All living things must eventually die, and all come ultimately to the end in the Gloom. Shadows, blood, silence, the dead, and even utter destruction all dance to the necromancer's tune.</p>
