<p><em>&quot;Have you gotten a look at the neighbors?&quot;</em></p>
<p>The realm of horror described in After Sundown is not merely the existence of nightmare worlds from which danger constantly leaks in to disrupt suburban homemaking, it also has people in it. People who are major characters and people who are the victims in slasher flicks. Sometimes, these are the same people.</p>
<h2 id="people-in-horror-extras-and-luminaries"><a class="header" href="#people-in-horror-extras-and-luminaries">People in Horror: Extras and Luminaries</a></h2>
<p><em>&quot;Do not run upstairs! There is no exit upstairs!&quot;</em></p>
<p>Remember that in horror movies there are a lot of people who serve no real purpose save to be eaten by the monsters. We call them Extras even if they happen to get some lines. These people may be strong, or smart, or beautiful, but ultimately they are doomed. If they get bitten by a zombie they will turn into one of the shambling hordes that our heroes must eventually chop through with a chain saw. They will not get cured and will not turn into leaders of the walking dead. Game mechanically, these people have no Edge score. If they turn into a supernatural creature of some kind they will become a <em>Spawn</em>. These hapless victims will not become the next Dracula, they will always be the horde vampires in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116367/">From Dusk Till Dawn</a>. They will not become Shelly Winters or Sheila, they will join the hordes of deadites and get cleaved through with fire.</p>
<p>On the other side of the coin, there <em>are</em> people in the horror genre who rise to the occasion. Whether they are introduced as badasss adventurers like Van Helsing or Rick O'Connell, or are &quot;normal people&quot; who rise to the occasion like Meg Penny or Ash, these people have a certain spark of badassery in them regardless of what they happen to be doing. They are <em>Luminaries</em>, and they have Edge. If they become Supernaturals they become the real deal. They may turn evil but they will still have lines and character development.</p>
<p>This is why characters will occasionally fight their way through a horde of zombies (who are of course <em>all</em> ex-humans) just to try to get a cure for one woman who happens to have been turned into a zombie. It isn't that they've completely lost perspective, it's that the transformation into a monster is a one way trip for absolutely everyone except a reasonably small number of luminaries. You actually can &quot;save&quot; Alice or Sheila if they get transformed into the living dead. There's literally nothing you can do for the rest of the people except shooting them in the face.</p>
<p>The exact proportion of Extras to Luminaries need not be precise so long as the former vastly outnumber the later. A few per 10,000 is a fair estimate of the number of Luminaries if one is needed. Many of these are supernatural monsters or people involved with them in some way, but some are just slightly more than ordinary people until the story intersects their lives.</p>
<h2 id="the-playable-types"><a class="header" href="#the-playable-types">The Playable Types</a></h2>
<p>The Universal Monsters have a lot of stuff in there which is not appropriate for emulation. Sure, Lon Chaney is full of awesome and I have no problem watching his movies, but neither the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0016220/">Phantom of the Opera</a> nor the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0014142/">Hunchback of Notre Dame</a> is especially supernatural. They are both just creepy guys that act monstrously. On the other end of the spectrum, the existence of space aliens harms the theme of otherworldly intrigue. So while <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047577/">This Island Earth</a> is a good movie and part of the official pantheon, the Metalunans and Zagons are not going to be part of this as visitors from space.</p>
<p>Which leaves Dracula, Frankenstein's Monster, Gillman, the Mummy, and the Wolfman - who all appear in the motion picture classic <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093560/">The Monster Squad</a>, and the Evil Wizard, the Invisible Man, and the Mole Man - who don't. It is of note however that Dracula, Frankenstein's Monster, the Wolfman, and The Invisible Man all appear in the equally mandatory movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0040068/">Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein</a>, and there is of course Evil Wizard and Mummy in the substantially less mandatory <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047795/">Abbott and Costello Meet the Mummy</a>. It seems clear that life would go on without Mole Men, but <em>what the heck?</em> We've got Mole Man in After Sundown, we call them Troglodytes.</p>
<p>Each of these broad categories of monsters varies based on the different worlds they draw their powers from, giving us Vampires from Shadow of the Vampire and Vampires from The Lost Boys that have both commonalities and differences.</p>
<h3 id="vampires"><a class="header" href="#vampires">Vampires</a></h3>
<p><em>An eternity of melancholy and betrayal is, after all, an eternity.</em></p>
<p>The Vampire is a rockstar of the living dead. They drink blood, live forever, and look great in black. Vampires are emotionally attenuated individuals who have to consume metaphorical life in the form of actual human blood. They are parasites whose very existence is a powerful metaphor for the consumptive and conflict-torn nature of the world.</p>
<p><strong>Exemplars:</strong> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0021814/">Dracula</a>. Did we mention <em>Dracula</em>? I mean sure, we can talk about the vampires from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120611/">Blade</a> or <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118276/">Buffy</a>, and we will even. But all Vampire mythos in the modern world always comes back to Dracula, because he is that awesome. And a special &quot;also-ran&quot; to the beast from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0013442/">Nosferatu</a>, because he is also awesome. <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093437">The Lost Boys</a> merits mandatory inclusion for the transformation sequences and pop-culture self-consumption.</p>
<h3 id="animates"><a class="header" href="#animates">Animates</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;Once created, a work has a life of its own.&quot;</em></p>
<p>An Animate is an artificial person. Created by unwise science, magic, or both, each Animate is a race of one. They have no peers and no possibility of children. Every Animate is created knowing that their entire people dies with them. It is a lonely and frightening existence. The Animate story is classically one that exists to explore the tragedy of dysfunctional human relationships - whether it be a child scorned by their parents, a lover scorned by the object of their affection, or simply a working person cast aside by those they worked for. The book Frankenstein explores much the same themes as a Bruce Springsteen album.</p>

<h3 id="lycanthropes"><a class="header" href="#lycanthropes">Lycanthropes</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;Even a man who is pure in heart and says his prayers by night...<br />
may become a wolf when the wolfbane blooms and the autumn moon is bright.&quot;</em></p>
<p>A Lycanthrope is someone who is cursed to transform into a rampaging beast when the moon is full or they get excited. There is plenty of mythological basis for shapeshifters who are born with the ability to turn into animals or who have attained the magic powers to do so to protect mankind, but they aren't normally figures from <em>horror</em> stories, and they aren't the Lycanthropes of After Sundown. Being a Lycanthrope means that you are a danger to people you love and the furniture around you. You can unleash the beast to rip things to pieces, but Lycanthropy is a <em>curse</em> and it is not generally very fun.</p>

<h3 id="witches"><a class="header" href="#witches">Witches</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;Bubble Bubble.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Witches are people who have learned Magic. In a horror setting, magic is in almost all cases bad. The genre is pretty light on Glinda the Goods and Merlins. Magicians are generally vindictive cackling hags, satanic sorcerers, zombie-makers, mysterious strangers, and a myriad of other titles both hackneyed and terrifying. They spend a lot more time sacrificing people to gods ancient and evil and a lot less time preparing good children to go to the ball than magicians in other genres.</p>
<p>The magic that humans can use comes from three sources in After Sundown. There is the magic of Death, which is evil. There is Devil magic, which is evil. And finally, there is the twisted sorceries of Nightmares, and that's evil as well. It's not that you can't do good as a magician, you totally can. It's just that the magic itself is evil and using it is dangerous even if you are the virtuous <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0022753/">Chandu</a>. While a character may well be a voodoo death magician or an Aztec or Egyptian death magician, the magical power set is all the same. Death magic is death magic whether you call upon bones with Chinese calligraphy or African chants.</p>
<p>An important thing to realize is that The Mummy is just a Witch.  That's just how they do immortality. Sometimes it's immortality where you do evil magic and you look like a normal person (see the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0023245/">1933</a> <em>or</em> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120616/">1999</a> The Mummy) and sometimes you look like a crazy corpse in special bandages (like in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0281686/">Bubba Ho-Tep</a>). It depends. Either way, if you want to be a leftover from Egypt or Aztlan you are a Witch (or a Vampire of course). However, and this is important, the Mummies from the middle Mummy movies such as <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0037099/">The Mummy's Ghost</a> and... sigh... <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0037098/">The Mummy's Curse</a>, where the Mummy lurches around and smashes things, that Mummy is an Animate or Revenant instead. So pick a shtick and go with it.</p>

<h3 id="transhuman"><a class="header" href="#transhuman">Transhuman</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;Just a scientific experiment. To do something no other man in the world had done.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Humans do not, in general, have supernatural powers. However, in the horror genre, there are people who experience an event that changes them irrevocably into something different. Something <em>more</em>. These people generally go stark raving mad, and in not very long. The certainty that they are no longer human causes them to lose sight of human priorities, human morality. While they have become something more, they are also something <em>less</em>.</p>
<p>The transformational event can be scientific or magical. Or a bit of both. A Transhuman always has an &quot;origin story&quot; which is to some degree unique. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0024184/">The Invisible Man</a> took scientific chemicals. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0046350/">Anck Su Namun</a> simply woke up one day and realized that she is the reincarnation of an Egyptian princess. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayesha_%28novel%29">Ayesha</a> stepped into the mystical <em>flame of life</em> and stepped out an inhuman thing. Whatever the event was, it was the last thing that he or she did as a human, and the reality of that fact is as destructive to the self as the subsequent revelations of the magical world and the horrors which inhabit it.</p>

<h3 id="leviathan"><a class="header" href="#leviathan">Leviathan</a></h3>
<p><em>His face was fish-like.</em></p>
<p>Supposedly in pre-Sumerian times, there was a great mother of monsters. Her name was Tiamat. Or Vritra. It's not that important what her name was, because she was killed by a powerful human sorcerer around 4000 BCE, and most of her monstrous brood is gone as well. But not all of it. Some of them interbred with humans and hid their lineage in the darkest corners of the world. They hid from the world of men for millennia, some lurking in the darkness and plotting revenge and others merely living their own lives - the ancient conflict is long forgotten.</p>
<p>But that's not possible anymore. Things are modern, and there is nowhere to hide. Those who carry the taint of Tiamat's spawn in their ancestry or are cursed with the taint during their lives are both hunted and feared. They are destructive, and eating their flesh can make you live forever. Of course, eating their flesh makes you like them, and puts you into the same danger. But hey, immortality.</p>
<p>In After Sundown, these creatures often hang out at the edges of society - places which while nominally explored aren't actually <em>watched</em> very carefully.</p>

<h2 id="the-non-playable-types"><a class="header" href="#the-non-playable-types">The Non-Playable Types</a></h2>
<p>Not only must we make explicit what appears on the player's side, we also need to decide ahead of time what is around, supernaturally speaking <em>in the world</em>. Many people protest this. If they want to have unicorns show up for a storyline, why shouldn't they, as the MC, just do that? The answer is that in a cooperative storytelling game, the players need some sort of ground state to tell their own backstories and to make plans for future intrigue. Whether or not the <em>character</em> knows that such and such a creature exists or such and such a world-spanning organization is up to its evil schemes, the <em>player</em> needs to at the very least have access to that information. And while it may seem like that would spoil surprises - and it does sometimes - in a much more important way it prevents <em>narrative dissonance</em>. Narrative dissonance appears in cooperative storytelling games much the way continuity errors appear in horror films. And while it is certainly jarring to watch the part in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107387/">Leprechaun</a> where they drive off in the second car even though they had earlier lamented being stranded when the first car wouldn't start - it is still a movie and thus the plot (such as it is) just keeps rolling along whether you notice the discrepancy or not. In a cooperative storytelling game however, such an event would just crash everything to a halt. The players and the MC would have to sit down and work something out because they are all imagining the world together and there is no &quot;next scene&quot; until everyone gets their imaginations working together.</p>
<h3 id="zombies"><a class="header" href="#zombies">Zombies</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;Brains!&quot;</em></p>
<p>Zombies are the result of evil magic, ghastly diseases, or super-science which transforms dead bodies into lurching, brain-eating monsters. Zombies have an insatiable hunger for the living and a tendency to rampage constantly. Some zombies are fast, some are slow. Some can figure out doorknobs and others can't. But they all hunger for the living. Zombies can create new zombies just by killing extras, so zombie outbreaks can get really big, really fast.</p>

<h3 id="goblins"><a class="header" href="#goblins">Goblins</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;Ha! Ha!&quot;</em></p>
<p>Some of the faeries in horror movies come from the same ghastly hell dimension that the demons do. These are <em>not</em> the shimmering pixies from Neverland, these are the hideous flesh-eating goblins from the Goblin Market. They come in small and extra-large sizes, and are generally easy to confuse.</p>

<h3 id="fae"><a class="header" href="#fae">Fae</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;Elves are terrific. They beget terror.&quot;</em></p>
<p>The other faeries of horror are a slightly more subtle lot if all the more terrifying for it. While they do include shimmering pixies, they're just there to lure you in so the servants of the court may decide how your life will be spent away. And some of them are happy to <em>pretend</em> to be aliens if that's what makes people scream the right way.</p>

<p><em>&quot;My God!&quot;<br />
&quot;Not yet, human. Soon... very soon I will be.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Made entirely of evil magic, the demons are a strange force that seeks to hurt humans and steal souls. Some appear as beautiful humans with or without horns and wings, and others look like the most nightmarish beasts the special effects budget could afford.</p>

<h3 id="ghosts"><a class="header" href="#ghosts">Ghosts</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;Boo!&quot;</em></p>
<p>When humans die and they are <em>super pissed</em> about something, they will occasionally linger on after death and become a ghost. Ghosts don't interact properly with physical objects and other people, and in any case are fed only by strong human emotions. So they gradually lose themselves and go batshit crazy, becoming a force that is more and more destructive.</p>

<p><em>&quot;But I wanted to know what it was like... how you feel.&quot;</em></p>
<p>In the Gloom there are things worse than the dead. Things that were never alive, but just pretend to be so they can walk among us and drink our lives like parasites. Their bodies are as hollow inside as their souls, and they wear dark glasses to hide the holes where their eyes should be. The least of them are barely more than plastic-looking zombies, but some grow strong and cunning on stolen life and memory.</p>

<p><em>&quot;Rar!&quot;</em></p>
<p>The wilderness of horror is a dangerous place with a spectacularly large array of things that can kill you. Man-eating beasts of tremendous size roam the woods, the lakes, the swamps, and probably the mountains. Being eaten by sharks, crocodiles, tigers, or <em>whatever</em> is a severe threat. And yes, these super charged zoo rejects have magic powers sometimes.</p>

<p><em>&quot;These things live on death and feed on ash.&quot;</em></p>

<p><em>&quot;From now on, I'm shooting my salad <strong>before</strong> I eat it.&quot;</em></p>
<p>The evil plants grow out of the ground in weird pods that make the soundtrack want to bust out theremin tracks.  They grow out of humans and often have mind control and other weird powers. These things might actually <em>be</em> from Space. But since they don't have a civilization or space ships (that we know of), it's not super important.</p>

<h2 id="monstrous-society"><a class="header" href="#monstrous-society">Monstrous Society</a></h2>
<p><em>&quot;There's evil stuff going on in here. And I want in.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Supernatural creatures are in the big scheme of things rather rare. An individual Werewolf may go their entire life without ever encountering another supernatural creature (beyond of course the Werewolf that mauled them into their current state in the first place). When they <em>do</em> find each other they tend to make exclusive clubs for their own safety. While an ordinary human is no match for a supernatural creature on their own, a group of humans can be a different story, so the monsters that survive tend to be the ones that form groups of their own. These social organizations are in many ways templated on the human social organizations that the creatures that created them lived in when they mingled in human society. And with the sheer <em>age</em> that some creatures possess, it is perhaps unsurprising that many of these organizations are in fact crazy old-fashioned.</p>
<h3 id="bands"><a class="header" href="#bands">Bands</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;Go Team Venture!&quot;</em></p>
<p>Supernatural creatures can easily overpower a single human, and many of them have at least the potential to <em>live forever</em>. But that potential can only be realized if they are not summarily destroyed before forever draws near. The response has been for small groups of supernatural creatures to watch each other's backs and contribute to each others' goals. These small teams are just as needed and just as effective as the hunting parties mankind first organized to fight cave bears. It has been suggested that the practice of supernatural creatures making these bands is perhaps no less old.</p>
<p>Loyalty to these small groups, whether you call it a &quot;band&quot; or &quot;team&quot; or &quot;coven&quot; or &quot;pack&quot; or &quot;family&quot; or just &quot;Fred&quot;, is assumed to be greater than loyalty to any world-spanning clubs. The Makhzen does not <em>expect</em> that you will betray your friends for them because it seriously isn't like you can go out and get new friends, especially if you have a reputation as a traitor. Immortality is a long time, and the number of supernaturals is never that large, so personal loyalties are considered extremely important by just about every one.</p>
<p>Most bands are generally 3-8 supernatural people with possibly some trusted retainers given quasi-membership. This is great for the game because one of them could very well be &quot;the player characters and maybe an NPC or two&quot;. And indeed, the general assumption is that players <em>will</em> be part of the same band. Doing things this way allows the mission statement of the band to act like Velcro to attach plot hooks to every player character, ensuring that the major action doesn't leave anyone behind. A band of Scooby Doo detectives can get all the players into the action right away when any of the characters find out about a supposedly haunted house, while a band of relic hunters can get the players up to speed with just the subtlest hint about the whereabouts of a famous pistol. Even a band of guys who meet together for pizza and poker night can be righteously mobilized when supernatural goings-on hamper their evening ritual.</p>
<p>Bands are thus structurally a very important part of the story arc for any group playing After Sundown because they provide a <em>reason</em> for the players to be telling the same story instead of having their characters drift apart and do their own thing. It is also important to note that many of the famous bands from genre television shows like X Files, American Gothic, and Supernatural only have two characters in them much of the time. Since After Sundown <em>is</em> a cooperative storytelling game, that is an unreasonable expectation to have. A better template would usually be the bands from more ensemble cast shows like Angel or even Scooby Doo.</p>
<h3 id="syndicates"><a class="header" href="#syndicates">Syndicates</a></h3>
<p><em>&quot;New plan: we <strong>don't</strong> cut each other's head off in an attempt to gain asymmetric power.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Whether they like it or not, supernatural characters in After Sundown are subject to the rules and judgments of one or more of the Syndicates. Acting as de facto nation-states, Syndicates provide a Hobbesian mandate of behavior that is difficult to ignore. Characters may indeed be a member of one of them, which provides benefits comparable to those of being the citizen of an archaic empire. However, breaking the edicts of <strong>any</strong> Syndicate is punishable by that Syndicate if it catches you (subject to possible negotiations if you are a well-placed member of another).</p>
<p>The Syndicates do not have directly analogous social hierarchies. Each is kind of like a mafia, with <em>some</em> sort of shady leadership hierarchy and elaborate titles to convey subtle differences in duties and status. But they were generally founded centuries and continents apart from one another, an they are not based on identical or even <em>comparable</em> theories of government. However, while each has very different justifications for its own existence, all the Syndicates exist to fulfill essentially the same functions and are essentially on the same side. So while they spend a fair amount of time insulting one another, it is profoundly unusual for them to actually come to blows. Each Syndicate provides the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Preserves the Vow of Silence</strong> - each group calls it something different, but everyone is keenly aware that sufficient numbers of peasants with torches have slain supernatural creatures in the past and will do so again if the lid isn't kept on pretty tight. In ages past this was handled with the &quot;Tradition of Misdirection&quot; where humans were fed bullshit about how magic really worked, when that started to break down during the Classical era, it was replaced with a system where supernatural creatures hid their existence from mortal observation entirely.</li>
<li><strong>Facilitates Social Interaction</strong> - for all the Nosferatu babble about how they prefer the life of the hermit, they really don't. Normal humans are incapable of really understanding what it is like to be a supernatural creature and really the only peers a Leviathan has is other Leviathans, or at least other supernatural creatures. Syndicates not only provide places and structure for this but will even make introductions for you.</li>
<li><strong>Acts as a framework to work out differences</strong> - supernatural creatures exist outside and in many ways above normal human societies, and live their life very much like a Hobbesian battle of All against All. And while it is true that their power and mystery does make them well qualified to do that, they have no unique advantages over other supernatural creatures. And thus it is in true Hobbes fashion the creatures have put together over organizations to keep each other in check.</li>
</ul>
<p>Syndicates do not, as a rule, recognize dual citizenship or anything of the like. And switching one's status from one to another is a slow painful process that generally just isn't done. But a supernatural creature from one Syndicate can generally expect to not get stabbed in the face or eaten by members of another. A supernatural creature from another Syndicate can expect to be treated as a foreigner, but not as a foreigner from a nation that is at war with the local one. Indeed, since all the Syndicates are international and borders are pretty vague even when they exist at all you can pretty much go where you want without getting much more than the fish eye. And that mostly from Leviathans who actually have fish eyes.</p>
<p>While various Syndicates have come and gone under various names, there are four extant in the modern world that make up pretty much the totality of ordered life among civilized monsters.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Makhzen:</strong> The oldest surviving Syndicate, the Makhzen are a shockingly baroque and millennia-old gathering of monsters supposedly dating back to ancient Babylon. Their Princes and Councils rule domains organized like the city states of antiquity still stretched across the path of the Silk Road.</li>
<li><strong>The Covenant:</strong> A quasi-Satanic inverted hierarchy that openly mocks the Catholic church of late antiquity in its structure. The Covenant has spread along much the same routes and holds territory in Southern Europe and Central America.</li>
<li><strong>The World Crime League:</strong> A group of former Makhzen domains that broke away in the midst of a Mongol invasion into Southwest Asia, the League reorganized itself as a pirate's council and has spread around the Pacific Rim on the back of organized crime.</li>
<li><strong>The Cauchemar Communes:</strong> Radical young (only centuries-old) monsters staged their own revolution against the power of the Covenant in the midst of the French Revolution and have swarmed much of the world along with the diaspora of political modernity.</li>

<h2 id="antagonistic-organizations"><a class="header" href="#antagonistic-organizations">Antagonistic Organizations</a></h2>
<p><em>&quot;Actually, those guys are just bastards. We fight them.&quot;</em></p>
<p>What makes an antagonist organization different from a &quot;normal&quot; organization in After Sundown is not that they are &quot;the bad guys&quot; - after all it is abundantly clear that a substantial number of people in <em>all</em> the supernatural societies are <em>bad guys</em>. These organizations are filled with blood-drinking <em>monsters</em>. No, the salient thing about the Antagonists in this setting is that they are not willing to live and let live with the members of other Syndicates and cults. So while it is entirely possible to have a story in which one character is from the Makhzen and another is from the Communes, it is basically impossible to have a cogent story in which one character is in the Marduk Society and the other characters are not.</p>
<p>The assumption then is that the antagonist organizations will be NPC only. The player characters will be members of the standard Syndicates or independents and as such the warriors of the Shattered Empire who show up at all it will do so as enemies. It is entirely possible to play a campaign in which every character is a member of the Marduk society, and that's fine. If you weren't OK with playing a game that skated closely to the edge of evil you wouldn't be playing a game about vampires and werewolves.</p>
<p>However, it's equally important to note that just because the King with Three Shadows may be a <em>villain</em> who is basically <em>at war</em> with the World Crime League, that does not mean that anyone is automatically on kill-on-sight terms with anyone else. Even these antagonistic organizations have diplomatic ties of some sort or another with all of the major Syndicates. These ties are <em>strained</em>, and ambassadors are sometimes recalled, but actual shooting wars have causes, beginnings, and negotiated <em>ends</em>.</p>
<p>Three major antagonist organizations can rival the Syndicates:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Marduk Society:</strong></li>
<li><strong>The King with Three Shadows:</strong></li>
<li><strong>The Shattered Empire:</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cults"><a class="header" href="#cults">Cults</a></h2>
<p><em>&quot;Has it ever occurred to you that maybe, just maybe, all the crazy pointless crap we do isn't crazy or pointless?&quot;</em></p>
<p>Many magical creatures attempt to increase their magical power by sharing secrets of magic with other supernatural creatures. These mystical file sharing groups serve as secret clubs, religious heresies, and trade guilds. These organizations are semi-secret. While their membership is largely composed of supernatural creatures (whose very existence is a secret from the mundane humans of the world), the specific activities of these groups are kept under wraps even from other supernaturals.</p>
<p>Each Cult is distinguished largely by 3 things. The first is their <strong>Favored Magic</strong>. This is the path of Sorcery that a character can reasonably expect to be taught by joining and advancing within the cult. The second is the <strong>Favored Resources</strong>. These are two resources that a character gets easily whilst a member of the cult in good standing. Further, the character's status within the cult is in some way enhanced by having lots of these backgrounds. And finally there is the <strong>Work</strong>. This is what the cult <em>does</em> in and around supernatural society. For example, the Ulmi family business is finance and bureaucracy, so other supernaturals frequently hire them to navigate human legalities on their behalf. On the flip side, The Black Hand makes it a point to murder people in cold blood, and supernaturals are rarely above hiring <em>them</em> to hammer down nails judged to be standing up.</p>
<p>A note on how to integrate each Cult's work into your chronicle has been included in each Cult's description. Each group has agendas that are in many ways fairly sketchy - and it is not at all inconceivable that the characters may find themselves working with or against any of them. Indeed, it's highly likely that characters will end up teaming up with and opposing the <em>same group</em> at different times. Cults fit a role somewhere between the Syndicates and purely antagonistic organizations in most chronicles.</p>
<p>While a cult could be as small as a single band, there are a few that span the world, or beyond. These major cults aren't a permanent presence in every city, but their agents often come and go throughout the supernatural world.</p>
