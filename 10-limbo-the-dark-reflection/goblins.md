## Goblins
_"I'll not rest till I have me gold. Curse this well that me soul shall dwell, till I find me magic that breaks me spell."_

The hideous goblins and gnarled ogres that make Limbo their home are stupid and vile.

All Goblins have an Infernal Power Source and suffer aggravated wounds from iron.

### Mirror Goblins
_"Everything is a scam to you, isn't it?"<br />
"Damn right it is."_

The Mirror Goblins are hideous and seemingly subhuman. They are small and misshapen, and they have hideous hooked teeth and claws. Mirror Goblins are a lot like the Black Isz from The Maxx or the Mumblers from Silent Hill. Left to their own devices, they mostly wander around Limbo gibbering and periodically eating each other. However, they are also oppressed by more powerful residents of the Dark Reflection. Whipped into shape by stronger creatures and groups they are used as disposable fodder and monsters of the week by The King with Three Shadows and other Infernal groups. Since they always have a Potency of zero, a Mirror Goblin can pass through any portal to Limbo, which is where they get their name: literally goblins who come into the Mortal World through mirrors.

While Mirror Goblins have strange pacmanesque mouths and rarely stand much over a meter tall, their muppetlike visages seem to have little difficulty being understood in human languages. When combined with their ability to magically disguise themselves, Mirror Goblins can actually penetrate human society with tolerable ease. They dare not stay long in the Mortal World though, because their power ritual can only be performed in Limbo. Mirror Goblins are generally regarded as being less than fully trustworthy.

The best media to look through to get a handle on Mirror Goblins is The Maxx, as they pretty much look and act like the Isz.

A Mirror Goblin was never human and has a nonstandard attribute array:

S: 3/8, A: 5/10, I: 4/10, L: 3/8, W: 3/8, C: 3/8

A Mirror Goblin has an Infernal power source and a Ritual power schedule. While they are inherently magical creatures they do not have Edge and their Potency is rated one and cannot develop further.

### Spriggans
_"Why there's nothing under this mask but a neck and some tendons!"_

Spriggans are hideous worm eaten things scarcely larger than a Mirror Goblin who can draw upon Infernal power to become massive killing machines. These beings look like hunks of maggot infested meat in an only barely humanoid shape, and they are quite boneless until they invoke their Giant Size and War Form, which are always enacted together. At that point their worms and flesh are pulled tight over a scaffold of long wet bones that end in sharp points in many places.

When a Spriggan performs its power ritual, it covers itself in spoiled food and soiled goods. The worms crawl out of it and grasp filth and offal to pull back into their cavernous interiors. Spriggans are quite susceptible to their Master Passion: Despair.

A Spriggan was never human and has a nonstandard attribute array:

S: 4/7, A: 4/10, I: 5/11, L: 4/8, W: 4/10, C: 4/8

A Spriggan has an Infernal power source and a Ritual power schedule.

### Gremlins

Gremlins are not old creatures. For all anyone knows, goblins have been more-or-less the same for millennia, but when humans started using complex machines to mine into the earth something new came out of the Dark Reflection. What might have at first been Mirror Goblins took to machinery and industry in a way that had never been seen before. Superstitious humans blamed them for ruining the ore in their mines and knocking in the tunnels pretending to be lost men and called them kobolds and knockers and (correctly) blamed all sorts of accidents and cantankerous machinery on them.

Gremlins didn't become widely known by that name until World War II, when they became part of RAF propaganda (a move that was no doubt clever propaganda on the part of the Communes in turn). They seemed to have grown in numbers as industrialization spread around the world.
Gremlins look like small, withered humans with spikes growing out of their spines and joints, large strange eyes, and small but nasty and sharp claws and teeth. They're not actually much brighter than Mirror Goblins, but they have a low cunning and an instinctive understanding of machines and technology of all kinds. Gremlins are drawn to machines and to kill people, but they tend to be divided between those that attach to a particular machine and those that drift about looking for new opportunities. They seam to feed on destruction; their power ritual requires them to connect with a machine that has killed someone.

A Gremlin was never human and has a nonstandard attribute array: 

S: 3/8 A: 4/10 I: 5/11 L: 2/7 W: 4/8 C: 2/6

A Gremlin has an Infernal power source and a Ritual power schedule. As Goblins they are vulnerable to iron and weakened by water.

### Trolls
_"Skin... Graaaaah... Tasty..."_

Within the prison world that is the Deep Reflection, hideous ogres prowl and punish or even murder those unlucky enough to fall into their clutches. But while they are the jailers of this foul realm, they are also its prisoners. Trolls spend almost every moment of their existence in agony and dejection, and eagerly take out their pains on others.

Hulking brutes with bulging musculature and an inhuman appearance, Trolls cannot actually turn their Giant Size _off_. These tortured giants of Limbo appear in literature as Tartarians and Pyramid Head. Trolls regain power by feeding on living things, often simply by swallowing them whole in their gaping maws. 

Trolls have a fairly multivarious appearance, varying from merely oversized humans to lumpy stone skinned oni with tremendous tusks. These changes are generally speaking purely cosmetic. Trolls have no difficulty recognizing different Trolls as being the same as themselves.

Trolls have a nonstandard attribute array because they were never humans. Before their Potency modifier and their constant Giant Size, their attribute ranges are:

S: 10/15, A: 4/8, I: 4/8, L: 3/7, W: 4/12, C: 3/7 E: 1/6 P: 3

A Troll has an Infernal power source and a Feeding power schedule.
