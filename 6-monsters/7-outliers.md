## The Outliers - The Fringes of Rejection

The Outliers aren't so much a type of supernatural monster as a loose grouping of monsters that other monsters just barely accept. They are at least nominally playable in an In Medias Res chronicle, but they'll always be under a degree of suspicion within the supernatural society of the Syndicates. Whether any of the Outliers are appropriate for a given Chronicle is up to the players and MC.

### Dryads
_"You seek for knowledge and wisdom, as I once did; and I ardently hope that the gratification of your wishes may not be a serpent to sting you, as mine has been."_

You know who doesn't have emotionally crippling experiences when exposed to the true horrors of the world? Plants. A person who replaces their heart with a seed handle most anything. Sometimes this is a deliberate process, and other times it is the providence of an evil seed taking control of someone in their sleep. Regardless, once a person's blood runs with sap they are forever more a Dryad.

The Dryad transformation is a bit like that of a Lycanthrope. When a Luminary is implanted with a Mind Root and uses a Luck to just barely resist it taking them over the root can be subsumed into their body, leaving their mind a strange amalgam of human and the emotionless root system inhabiting them. 

Dryads do not remember their dreams, even when woken in the middle of them. Their sweat smells like flowering trees. And they become plantish in their demeanor. Regaining their power requires that they put parts of their body into the ground and water themselves. When they draw their hands or feet out of the soil, there will momentarily be white rootlets that are rapidly drawn back into their pores with a sickening hiss.

Dryads most often have Master Passion Loneliness, representing their alienation from human emotion. A Dryad has an Astral power source and a Ritual power schedule. As a hybrid of a human and an Evil Plant they are vulnerable to iron and weakened by alcohol.

#### The First Dryad?

Dryads seem to have fist appeared during the Late Bronze Age collapse when the Fae lead massive invasions of Earth out of the Dreamlands and a plague of Evil Plants came with them, either hitching a ride or by some fey design. A slim handful of Luminaries around the world managed to break free of the Pods controlling them. Dryads were proscribed by the Makhzen for centuries, but diplomatic efforts by some of the first Mekhashfim to be called such resulted in the acceptance of Dryads into the fold. Despite all the centuries since many still regard Dryads as possible sleeper agents of the Evil Plants.

### Revenants
_"The Living Dead and the dying living are all the same. Cut from the same cloth. But disposing of dead people is a public service, whereas you're in all sorts of trouble if you kill someone while they're still alive."_

The Revenant is the talkative wight from virtually every piece of fiction where a Zombie is a major character. _Every_ Luminary who becomes a Zombie by _whatever_ means becomes a Revenant. Revenancy is curable, as can be plainly seen from both _Scary Go Round_ and _Army of Darkness_, and it is the only form of Zombie that is. A Revenant appears much as it did in life, save for pale white skin and darkness around the eyes. Basically they look like someone who is wearing heavy goth makeup, save that there is something _obviously_ unnatural about them that even the most casual observer can plainly see.

Revenants do not lose their reasoning faculties nor their personal moral compass. However, they _do_ hunger for the brains of the living, and are doomed to gradually weaken and lose power until they devour such. Eating the brain of a human refreshes their Power batteries, but they _don't_ have an unobtrusive or Vow of Silence upholding alternative at their disposal. Sooner or later, they _will_ be compelled to break open a human skull and feast on the morsels inside. It is for this reason that even the usually quite open minded supernatural societies would generally prefer that Revenants be cured or destroyed - their mere presence endangers the Vow of Silence more than most Syndicates are willing to condone. The fact that they can all also spread zombification doesn't help either, but sometimes they are accepted if they can demonstrate an ability to get by as ghoulish devourers of existing corpses.

Revenants are almost always subject to Master Passion Hunger. They have an Orphic power source and a Feeding power schedule. As undead they are vulnerable to wood and weakened by sunlight.

#### The First Revenant

By all reports there have been zombies nearly as long as their have been humans, and Revenants have been involved in supernatural society from the beginning of the Makhzen. In the early centuries CE a few too many zombie outbreaks started rising the ire of more militant enforcers of the Vow of Silence, and accepted Revenants became something of a tolerated legacy so long as they didn't create more of their kind, their numbers slowly dwindling with time. It wasn't until the Communes started accepting them in the early 19th century - and making a corresponding fuss if their citizens weren't tolerated by the other Syndicates - that Revenants started to become a lasting part of the supernatural scene again.
