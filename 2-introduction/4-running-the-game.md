# Running the Game

After Sundown is a collaborative storytelling game, where all the players except one take the roles of the protagonists in an ensemble story set in the realm of horror. The odd player out is the MC, who acts as narrator, director, and actor of last resort for all the other characters in the story. The MC has substantial leeway in interpreting how events unfold and is responsible for much of the writing of the backstory. Nevertheless, the story is still _about_ the player characters, and no one should forget that.

Player characters will have numbers and abilities written on a character sheet that demonstrate what they are capable of, but in most cases the players themselves will determine what their character actually does. When actions are declared, dice are often rolled to determine the results of the action. But when that is not enough (or would be too tedious as is the case for many minor actions), the MC can deterministically assign results.

Actual stories are told cooperatively, with players bringing up events relevant to their character's backstory and possibilities for the MC to consider weaving into the ongoing description of the world and having real solid first person narrative control over the actions and dialog of their player character. The MC is sometimes said to be "running" the game, because they provide the narrative control on the stage where the protagonists act.

## Basic Dice Mechanics

When you perform an action, you roll a pile of d6s called a _Dicepool_. Dice which come up as a 5 or 6 are _Hits_. A task's required number of hits is its _Threshold_. Any hits gained in addition to that are _Net Hits_ (that is, Net Hits = Hits - Threshold). If a die roll generates enough hits the attempt is a success, otherwise it's a failure.

The effects one can expect out of getting a number of Hits are proportionately more awesome as the number of hits increases:

| Hits | Awesomeness |
|:----:|:------------|
| 0    | Not Awesome. Tying shoes, climbing stairs. |
| 1    | Completely Pedestrian. Driving a car, throwing Darts. |
| 2    | Ordinary. Driving in the rain, hitting a bullseye at the range|
| 3    | Professional. Don't try this at home. Formula One racing, surgery |
| 4    | Hard. Don't try this at all. Movie stunts, brain surgery |
| 5    | Extreme. |
| 6    | Crazy Extreme. |
| 7    | Super Human. Does not need disclaimers because it is clearly impossible. |

### Rating

"Rating" is a term generically used for measuring something that relates to dice mechanics. The unit of a Rating is a "point", which amounts to one die in a pool or a threshold change of one. The most common Ratings are the Attributes and Skills of characters, but it also can refer to the toughness of objects or the difficulty of working with them, the damage dealt by weapons or deflected by armor, the inherent force of certain Powers, or arbitrary things like the gauntlet between Limbo and Earth. The Rating of an object is often used as the threshold for the most particular actions that would be taken on it, such as a lock having a Rating for how difficult it is to bypass whether with force or finesse.

### Dicepools

Your dicepool is generally speaking a pile of d6s with dice equal to your character's Attribute + Skill, and circumstantial modifiers increase or decrease the number of dice rolled. A human Extra's attributes go up to 9 and their skills up to 6. A supernatural creature's can go up higher than that because their Potency increases their Attribute maximums and their Edge increases their Skill maximums. As such, it is expected that supernatural critters will roll more dice on actions that their powers apply to than normal humans do.

### Defaulting

Sometimes people try doing something with no idea what they're doing; this is called _defaulting_. There may be a penalty to the dicepool for defaulting without the appropriate Active Skill or Background to perform the task, generally -1.

### Resistance Tests

Sometimes a character will be allowed to _resist_ something being done to them. This is done by rolling dice like normal, save that rather than generating an awesome result, the character is merely reducing the number of hits against them, making whatever is being done to them take less or even no effect. In general, a Physical Resistance Test is simply a Strength roll, a Mental Resistance Test is an Intuition roll, and a Social Resistance Test is a Willpower roll, although some strange powers are resisted with other Attributes. If a character has an Edge score, it is added to these Resistance tests. When a character is struck with an attack they may be called upon to make a Soak roll, which is a special kind of Physical Resistance Test that also adds their appropriate Armor value to the roll (if any). In most cases, if the Resistance Test reduces the number of hits on a test to zero or less, the original attempt has failed.

### Initiative Tests

When it's important to know which characters are able to act first in a situation - or in what order - an Initiative Test is called for. Each character that wishes to participate rolls Agility + Intuition (an exception to the normal rule that dicepools will be Attribute + Skill) and takes the number of hits as their Initiative Score. Characters act in order of Initiative Scores, and characters whose scores are the same act simultaneously. A character who gets a higher Initiative Score may choose to act _after_ characters with a lower Initiative Score if they want. 

### Extended Tests and Timing of Actions

Most actions take an expected amount of time. If a character gets the requisite number of hits, they succeed in the expected amount of time. If they get more than the requisite number of hits, they may complete the task well ahead of schedule. For every hit made in excess of the minimum, move to the next lower amount of time on the time chart. If a character fails to succeed, they may retry, but only after having put in the normal time into the first shot. So for example: Mina is attempting to paint a house (Strength + Artisan, 1, 2 days) and gets 3 hits. Since she got 2 more hits than she needed, she can go to the next lower time period twice, bringing the time frame down to five hours.

| Step  | Time Period |
|:------|:------------|
| 0		| Free Action |
| 1		| Simple Action |
| 2		| 1 Round/Complex Action |
| 3		| 1 minute |
| 4		| 5 minutes |
| 5		| 20 minutes |
| 6		| 1 hour |
| 7		| 5 hours |
| 8		| 1 day |
| 9		| 3 days |
| 10	| 1 week |
| 11	| 1 month |
| 12	| 1 season/quarter |
| 13	| 1 year |
| 14	| 1 decade |
| 15	| 1 century |
| 16+	| Eternal |

Of special note are the first three entries. A round is a period of approximately 12 seconds used to mark the finest time period that the game tracks. At this granularity Initiative Score is used to determine the order in which actions occur. Normally, a character can perform either one Complex or two Simple actions in a Round, in addition to Free Actions and Reactions (which take practically negligible time).

### Predictable Failure:

Sometimes a character will be struggling under enough penalties that they don't have a dice pool at all. In these instances, the character is going to get zero hits, which means that absolutely nothing they do will be awesome. They can still stagger down the corridor or open a door, but as soon as a stunt requires even one hit they are going to fail unless they are a Luminary who can spend Edge on the problem to get some dice and a chance.

### Team Work

When more than one character throws their weight into a project they can achieve results that are more awesome and in less time than what either character could achieve alone. However, the game mechanics completely break down if you just add the dicepool of one character to another. What is done instead is that whichever character has the best dicepool is considered the main acting character, and the other characters are considered the assisting characters. Each assisting character makes their check, and each hit is added as a bonus die on the main character's test. Since characters get about 1 hit per three dice, on average improving the awesomeness of a task is "hard" (threshold 3). In many cases an MC will allow a character to assist with a tangential but vaguely related skill (and in such cases it is entirely possible for one of the assisting characters to roll more dice than the main acting character).

Too many cooks spoil the broth. How many characters qualify as "too many" is unfortunately a very fluid concept that depends a lot on what you're doing. Sometimes there are real physical limits to how many people can literally fit around a project, and other times it's procedural. In general, most teamwork projects should be handled with five or less people. A project larger than that should probably be split into multiple tests, although at the MC's discretion there may be exceptions. A good set of management protocols is essential for most group projects to move forward. Most of the time, no more assisting characters can work on a project than the highest Tactics skill of the characters. The character providing the tactics skill allowing multiple characters to work on the project need not be the main acting character, and often will not be.
