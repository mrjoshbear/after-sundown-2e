# Terrible People
_Have you gotten a look at the neighbors?_

The realm of horror described in After Sundown is not merely the existence of nightmare worlds from which danger constantly leaks in to disrupt suburban homemaking, it also has people in it. People who are major characters and people who are the victims in slasher flicks. Sometimes, these are the same people.

## People in Horror: Extras and Luminaries
_"Do not run upstairs! There is no exit upstairs!"_

Remember that in horror movies there are a lot of people who serve no real purpose save to be eaten by the monsters. We call them Extras even if they happen to get some lines. These people may be strong, or smart, or beautiful, but ultimately they are doomed. If they get bitten by a zombie they will turn into one of the shambling hordes that our heroes must eventually chop through with a chain saw. They will not get cured and will not turn into leaders of the walking dead. Game mechanically, these people have no Edge score. If they turn into a supernatural creature of some kind they will become a _Spawn_. These hapless victims will not become the next Dracula, they will always be the horde vampires in [From Dusk Till Dawn](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116367/). They will not become Shelly Winters or Sheila, they will join the hordes of deadites and get cleaved through with fire.

On the other side of the coin, there _are_ people in the horror genre who rise to the occasion. Whether they are introduced as bad ass adventurers like Van Helsing or Rick O'Connell, or are "normal people" who rise to the occasion like Meg Penny or Ash, these people have a certain spark of bad assery in them regardless of what they happen to be doing. They are _Luminaries_, and they have Edge. If they become Supernaturals they become the real deal. They may turn evil but they will still have lines and character development.

This is why characters will occasionally fight their way through a horde of zombies (who are of course _all_ ex-humans) just to try to get a cure for one woman who happens to have been turned into a zombie. It isn't that they've completely lost perspective, it's that the transformation into a monster is a one way trip for absolutely everyone except a reasonably small number of luminaries. You actually can "save" Alice or Sheila if they get transformed into the living dead. There's literally nothing you can do for the rest of the people except shoot them in the face.

The exact proportion of Extras to Luminaries need not be precise so long as the former vastly outnumber the later. A few per 10,000 is a fair estimate of the number of Luminaries if one is needed. Many of these are supernatural monsters or people involved with them in some way, but some are just slightly more than ordinary people until the story intersects their lives.

## The Playable Types

The Universal Monsters have a lot of stuff in there which is not really appropriate for emulation. Sure, Lon Chaney is full of awesome and I have no problem watching his movies, but neither the [Phantom of the Opera](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0016220/) nor the [Hunchback of Notre Dame](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0014142/) is especially supernatural. They are both just really creepy guys. On the other end of the spectrum, the existence of space aliens really harms the whole eldritch intrigue thing. So while [This Island Earth](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047577/) is a good movie and part of the official pantheon, the Metalunans and Zagons are not going to be part of this. At least, not as such.

Which leaves Dracula, Frankenstein's Monster, Gillman, the Mummy, and the Wolfman - who all appear in the motion picture classic [The Monster Squad](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093560/), and the Evil Wizard, the Invisible Man, and the Mole Man - who don't. It is of note however that Dracula, Frankenstein's Monster, the Wolfman, and the Invisible Man all appear in the equally mandatory movie [Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0040068/), and there is of course Evil Wizard and Mummy in the substantially less mandatory [Abbott and Costello Meet the Mummy](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047795/). It seems clear that life would go on without Mole Men, but _what the heck?_ We've got Mole Man in After Sundown, we call them Troglodytes.

Each of these broad categories of monster are varied based on the different worlds they draw thier powers from.

### Vampires
_An eternity of melancholy and betrayal is, after all, an eternity._

The Vampire is a rockstar of the living dead. They drink blood, live forever, and look great in black. Vampires are emotionally attenuated individuals who have to consume metaphorical life in the form of actual human blood. They are parasites whose very existence is a powerful metaphor for the consumptive and conflict-torn nature of the world.

**Exemplars:** [Dracula](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0021814/). Did we mention _Dracula_? I mean sure, we can talk about the vampires from [Blade](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120611/) or [Buffy](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118276/), and we will even. But all Vampire mythos in the modern world always comes back to Dracula, because he is that awesome. And a special "also-ran" to the beast from [Nosferatu](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0013442/), because he is also awesome. [The Lost Boys](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093437) merits mandatory inclusion for the transformation sequences and pop-culture consuming itself.

### Animates
_Once created, a work has a life of its own._

An Animate is an artificial person. Created by unwise science, magic, or both, each Animate is a race of one. They have no peers and no possibility of children. Every Animate is created knowing that their entire people dies with them. It is a lonely and frightening existence. The Animate story is classically one that exists to explore the tragedy of dysfunctional human relationships - whether it be a child scorned by their parents, a lover scorned by the object of their affection, or simply a working person cast aside by those they worked for. The book Frankenstein explores much the same themes as a Bruce Springsteen album.

**Exemplars:** [Frankenstein's Monster](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0021884/), [Rotwang's Robot](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0017136/), [Loew's Golem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golem#The_classic_narrative:_The_Golem_of_Prague)

### Lycanthropes
_Even a man who is pure in heart and says his prayers by night...<br />
may become a wolf when the wolfbane blooms and the autumn moon is bright._

A Lycanthrope is someone who is cursed to transform into a rampaging beast when the moon is full or they get excited. There is plenty of mythological basis for shapeshifters who are born with the ability to turn into animals or who have attained the magic powers to do so to protect mankind, but they aren't normally figures from _horror_ stories, and they aren't the Lycanthropes of After Sundown. Being a Lycanthrope means that you are a danger to people you love and the furniture around you. You can unleash the beast to rip things to pieces, but lycanthropy is a _curse_ and it is not generally very fun.

**Exemplars:** [John Talbot](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0034398/), [Irena Dubrovna](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0034587/), [Yuki Sohma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuki_Sohma)

### Witches
_Bubble Bubble._

Witches are people who have learned Magic. In a horror setting, magic is in almost all cases bad. The genre is pretty light on Glinda the Goods and Merlins. Magicians are generally vindictive cackling hags, satanic sorcerers, zombie-makers, mysterious strangers, and a myriad of other titles both hackneyed and terrifying. They spend a lot more time sacrificing people to gods ancient and evil and a lot less time preparing good children to go to the ball than magicians in other genres.

Magic that humans can use comes from three sources in After Sundown. There is the magic of Death, which is evil. There is Devil magic, which is evil. And finally there is the twisted sorceries of Nightmares, and that's evil as well. It's not that you can't do good as a magician, you totally can. It's just that the magic itself is evil and using it is dangerous even if you are the virtuous [Chandu](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0022753/). While a character may well be a voodoo death magician or an Aztec or Egyptian death magician, the magical power set is all the same. Death magic is death magic whether you call upon bones with Chinese caligraphy or African chants.

An important thing to realize is that The Mummy is actually a Witch.  That's just how they do immortality. Sometimes it's an immortality where you do evil magic and you look like a normal person (see the [1933](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0023245/) _or_ [1999](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120616/) The Mummy) and sometimes you look like a crazy corpse in special bandages (like in [Bubba Ho-Tep](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0281686/)). It really depends. Either way, if you want to be a leftover from Egypt or Aztlan you are a Witch (or a Vampire of course). However, and this is important, the Mummies from the middle Mummy movies such as [The Mummy's Ghost](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0037099/) and... sigh... [The Mummy's Curse](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0037098/), where the Mummy lurches around and smashes things, that Mummy is an Animate instead. So pick a schtick and go with it.

**Exemplars:** [Imhotep](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0023245/), [Roxor](http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0047508/), [Hjalmar Poelzig](http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0049196/), [Chandu](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0022753/)

### Transhuman
_Just a scientific experiment. To do something no other man in the world had done._

Humans do not, in general, have supernatural powers. However, in the horror genre there are a number of people who experience an event which changes them irrevocably into something different. Something _more_. These people generally go stark raving mad, and in not very long. The certainty that they are no longer human causes them to lose sight of human priorities, human morality. While they have become something more, they are also something _less_.

The transformational event can be scientific or magical. Or a bit of both. A Transhuman always has an "origin story" which is to some degree unique. [The Invisible Man](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0024184/) took scientific chemicals. [Anck Su Namun](http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0046350/) simply woke up one day and realized that she is the reincarnation of an Egyptian princess. [Ayesha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayesha_%28novel%29) stepped into the mystical _flame of life_ and stepped out an inhuman thing. Whatever the event was, it was the last thing that he or she did as a human, and the reality of that fact is as destructive to the self as the subsequent revelations of the magical world and the horrors which inhabit it.

**Exemplars:** [The Invisible Man](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0024184/), [Mr. Hyde](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0022835/), [Anck Su Namun](http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0046350/), [Ayesha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayesha_%28novel%29)

### Leviathan
_His face was fish-like._

Supposedly in pre-Sumerian times there was a great mother of monsters. Her name was Tiamat. Or Vritra. It's not really that important what her name was, because she was killed by a powerful human sorcerer around 4000 BCE, and most of her monstrous brood is gone as well. But not all of it. Some of them interbred with humans and hid their lineage in the darkest corners of the world. They hid from the world of men for millennia, some lurking in darkness and plotting revenge and others merely living their own lives - the ancient conflict long forgotten.

But that's not really possible now. Things are modern, and there is nowhere to hide. Those who carry the taint of Tiamat's spawn in their ancestry or are cursed with the taint during their lives are both hunted and feared. They are destructive, and eating their flesh can make you live forever. Of course, eating their flesh makes you like them, and puts you into the same danger. But hey, immortality.

In After Sundown, these creatures often hang out at the edges of society - places which while nominally explored aren't actually _watched_ very carefully.

**Exemplars:** [Gillman](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0046876/), [Mole Man](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049516/), [Robert Olmstead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shadow_over_Innsmouth), [Moth Man](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1514425/)

## The Non-Playable Types

Not only must we make explicit what appears on the player's side, we also need to decide ahead of time what is around, supernaturally speaking _in the world_. Many people protest this. If they want to have unicorns show up for a storyline, why shouldn't they, as the MC, just do that? The answer is that in a cooperative storytelling game, the players need some sort of ground state to tell their own back stories and to make plans for future intrigue. Whether or not the _character_ knows that such and such a creature exists or such and such a world spanning organization is up to its evil schemes, the _player_ needs to at the very least have access to that information. And while it may seem like that would spoil surprises - and it does sometimes - in a much more important way it prevents _narrative dissonance_. Narrative dissonance appears in cooperative storytelling games much the way continuity errors appear in horror films. And while it is certainly jarring to watch the part in [Leprechaun](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107387/) where they drive off in the second car despite the fact that they had earlier lamented being stranded when the first car wouldn't start - it is still a movie and thus the plot (such as it is) just keeps rolling along whether you notice the discrepancy or not. In a cooperative storytelling game however, such an event would just crash everything to a halt. The players and the MC would have to sit down and work something out, because they are all imagining the world together and there is no "next scene" until everyone gets their imaginations working together.

### Zombies
_Brains!_

Zombies are the result of evil magic, ghastly diseases, or super science which transforms dead bodies into lurching, brain eating monsters. Zombies hunger for the living and have a tendency to rampage constantly. Some zombies are fast, some are slow. Some can figure out doorknobs and others can't. But they all hunger for the living. Zombies can create new zombies just by killing extras, so zombie outbreaks can get really big, really fast.

**Exemplars:** [Julia](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107953/), [Sheila](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5580540/), [Ed](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1478478/), [Shelly Winters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scary_Go_Round)

### Goblins
_Ha! Ha!_

Some of the faeries in horror movies come from the same ghastly hell dimension that the demons do. These are _not_ the shimmering pixies from Neverland, these are the hideous flesh eating goblins from the Goblin Market. They come in small and extra large sizes, and are generally easy to confuse.

**Exemplars:** [The Leprechaun](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107387/), [Rumplestiltskin](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114306/), [Pyramidhead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid_Head)

### Fae
_Elves are terrific. They beget terror._

The other faeries of horror are a slightly more subtle lot, if all the more terrifying for it. While they do include shimmering pixies, they're just there to lure you in so the servants of the court may decide how your life will be spent away. And some of them are happy to _pretend_ to be aliens if that's what makes people scream the right way.

**Exemplars:** [Jereth](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091369/), [Pan](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0457430/), [Maleficent](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1587310)

### Demons
_"My God!"<br />
"Not yet, human. Soon... very soon I will be."_

Made entirely of evil magic, the demons are a strange force that seeks to hurt humans and steal souls. Some appear as beautiful humans with or without horns and wings, and others look like the most nightmarish beasts the special effects budget could afford.

**Exemplars:** [Wishmaster](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120524/), [Azazel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azazel_%28Marvel_Comics%29), Buju, The Lady in Red

### Ghosts
_Boo!_

When humans die and they are _super pissed_ about something, they will occasionally linger on after death and become a ghost. Ghosts don't interact properly with physical objects and other people, and in any case are fed only by strong human emotions. So they gradually lose themselves and go batshit crazy, becoming a force that is more and more destructive.

**Exemplars:** [Slimer](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097428/), [Patrick Swayze](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099653/), [The Mist](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0884328/)

#### Mockeries
_But I wanted to know what it was like... how you feel._

In the Gloom there are things worse than the dead. Things that were never alive, but just pretend to be so they can walk among us and drink our lives like parasites. Their bodies are as hollow inside as their souls, and they wear dark glasses to hide the holes where their eyes should be. The least of them are barely more than plastic-looking zombies, but some grow strong and cunning on stolen life and memory.

**Exemplars:** [The Strangers](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118929/), [The Corinthian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corinthian_(comics)), [Rasputin](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0167190/)

### Giant Animals
_Rar!_

The wilderness of horror is a dangerous place with a spectacularly large array of things that can kill you. Man eating beasts of tremendous size roam the woods, the lakes, the swamps, and probably the mountains. Being eaten by sharks, crocodiles, tigers, or _whatever_ is a severe threat. And yes, these super charged zoo rejects have magic powers sometimes.

**Exemplars:** [Jaws](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073195/), [Joe Young](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0041650/), [Boa](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0412523/), [Python](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0412523/)

### Hellspawn
_These things live on death and feed on ash._

Like demons and goblins, the great inhuman monsters of legend are trapped beyond the mortal world. While such things may have once walked the earth and hunted man, they are now limited to Limbo unless summoned by the foolish. When they do come out the world burns with their fury.

**Exemplars:** [Sammael](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0167190/), [Dragons](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0253556)

### Evil Plants
_From now on, I'm shooting my salad **before** I eat it._

The evil plants grow out of the ground in weird pods that make the soundtrack want to bust out theremin tracks.  They grow out of humans and often have mind control and other weird powers. These things might actually _be_ from Space. But since they don't have a civilization or space ships (that we know of), it's not super important.

**Exemplars:** [Body Snatchers](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106452/), [The Thing](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084787/), [Swamp Thing](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084745/), [Triffids](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055894/)

## Mounstrous Society
_"There's evil stuff going on in here. And I want in."_

Supernatural creatures are in the big scheme of things rather rare. An individual Werewolf may go their entire life without ever encountering another supernatural creature (beyond of course the Werewolf that mauled them into their current state in the first place). When they _do_ find each other they tend to make exclusive clubs for their own safety. While a ordinary human is no match for a supernatural creature on their own, a group of humans can be a different story, so the monsters that survive tend to be the ones that form groups of their own. These social organizations are in many ways templated on the human social organizations that the creatures that created them lived in when they mingled in human society. And with the sheer _age_ that some creatures possess, it is perhaps unsurprising that many of these organizations are in fact crazy old-fashioned.

## Bands
_"Go Team Venture!"_

Supernatural creatures can easily overpower a single human, and many of them have at least the potential to _live forever_. But that potential can only be realized if they are not summarily destroyed before forever draws near. The response has been for small groups of supernatural creatures to watch each other's backs and contribute to each others' goals. These small teams are just as needed and just as effective as the hunting parties mankind first organized to fight cave bears. It has been suggested that the practice of supernatural creatures making these bands is perhaps no less old.

Loyalty to these small groups, whether you call it a "band" or "team" or "pack" or "family" or just "Fred", is assumed to be greater than loyalty to any world spanning clubs. The Makhzen does not _expect_ that you will betray your friends for them, because it seriously isn't like you can go out and get new friends, especially if you have a reputation as a traitor. Immortality is a long time, and the number of supernaturals is never that large, so personal loyalties are considered extremely important by just about every one.

Most bands are generally 3-8 supernatural people with possibly some trusted retainers given quasi-membership. This is great for the game, because one of them could very well be "the player characters and maybe an NPC or two". And indeed, the general assumption is that players _will_ be part of the same band. Doing things this way allows the mission statement of the band to act as velcro to attach plot hooks to every player character, ensuring that the major action doesn't leave anyone behind. A band of Scooby Doo detectives can get all the players into the action right away when any of the characters finds out about a supposedly haunted house, while a band of relic hunters can get the players up to speed with just the subtlest hint about the whereabouts of a famous pistol. Even a band of guys who meet together for pizza and poker night can be righteously mobilized when supernatural goings-on hamper their evening ritual.

Bands are thus structurally a very important part of the story arc for any group playing After Sundown, because they provide a _reason_ for the players to be telling the same story instead of having their characters drift apart and do their own thing. It is also important to note that many of the famous bands from genre television shows like X Files, American Gothic, and Supernatural only have two characters in them much of the time. Since After Sundown _is_ a cooperative storytelling game, that is an unreasonable expectation to have. A better template would usually be the bands from more ensemble cast shows like Angel or even Scooby Doo.

## Syndicates
_"New plan: we **don't** cut each other's head off in an attempt to gain asymmetric power."_

Whether they like it or not, supernatural characters in After Sundown are subject to the rules and judgments of one or more of the Syndicates. Acting as defacto nation states, Syndicates provide a Hobbesian mandate of behavior that is difficult to ignore. Characters may indeed be a member of one of them, which provides benefits comparable to those of being the citizen of an archaic empire. However, breaking the edicts of **any** Syndicate is punishable by that Syndicate if it catches you (subject to possible negotiations if you are a well placed member of another).

The Syndicates do not have directly analogous social hierarchies. Each is kind of like a mafia, with _some_ sort of shady leadership hierarchy and elaborate titles to convey subtle differences in duties and status. But they were generally founded centuries and continents apart from one another, an they are not based on identical or even _comparable_ theories of government. However, while each has very different justifications for its own existence, all the Syndicates exist to fulfill essentially the same functions and are essentially on the same side. So while they spend a fair amount of time insulting one another, it is profoundly unusual for them to actually come to blows. Each Syndicate provides the following:

* **Preserves the Vow of Silence** - each group calls it something different, but everyone is keenly aware that sufficient numbers of peasants with torches have slain supernatural creatures in the past and will do so again if the lid isn't kept on pretty tight. In ages past this was handled with the "Tradition of Misdirection" where humans were fed bullshit about how magic really worked, when that started to break down during the Classical era, it was replaced with a system where supernatural creatures hid their existence from mortal observation entirely.
* **Facilitates Social Interaction** - for all the Nosferatu babble about how they prefer the life of the hermit, they really don't. Normal humans are incapable of really understanding what it is like to be a supernatural creature and really the only peers a Leviathan has is other Leviathans, or at least other supernatural creatures. Syndicates not only provide places and structure for this but will even make introductions for you.
* **Acts as a framework to work out differences** - supernatural creatures exist outside and in many ways above normal human societies, and live their life very much like a Hobbesian battle of All against All. And while it is true that their power and mystery does make them well qualified to do that, they have no unique advantages over other supernatural creatures. And thus it is in true Hobbes fashion the creatures have put together over organizations to keep each other in check.

Syndicates do not, as a rule, recognize dual citizenship or anything of the like. And switching one's status from one to another is a slow painful process that generally just isn't done. But a supernatural creature from one Syndicate can generally expect to not get stabbed in the face or eaten by members of another. A supernatural creature from another Syndicate can expect to be treated as a foreigner, but not as a foreigner from a nation that is at war with the local one. Indeed, since all the Syndicates are international and borders are pretty vague even when they exist at all you can pretty much go where you want without getting much more than the fish eye. And that mostly from Leviathans who actually have fish eyes.

While various Syndicates have come and gone under various names, there are four extant in the modern world that make up pretty much the totallity of ordered life among civilized monsters.

### The Makhzen
_"Lack of loyalty is one of the major causes of failure in every walk of life."_

The Makhzen is, according to its own history, an ancient truce declared between various supernatural creatures long ago in Babylon. It was apparently put together in the face of some grave threat which is no longer talked about. Members of the Makhzen are called "Kindred", and the regional leadership is divided into "cities", "domains", and "kingdoms" all of which terms are used interchangeably. Regional leadership is held by a Mehtar Council, which powerful kindred are appointed to for life, and this council is led by a Prince or Aval (both are unisex terms which predate their use in royalty). How much influence the prince actually has varies from region to region. A Mehtar or prince who travels to another domain is automatically a member of the Mehtar council wherever they happen to be.

Laws of the Makhzen are hopelessly baroque, and most of the old ones are shockingly specific and draconian and inscribed into clay tablets. They have by and large been repealed and replaced with ones which are easier for everyone to get along with. Still, there are some hangers on, as it is widely reported that it is still technically a death sentence for the perpetrator and their three closest friends to steal an aurochs from a member of the kindred.

Tonight, the Makhzen remains strong in the Middle East and North Africa. It has spread somewhat into North America in the American South. Once it extended the entire length of the Silk Road and all through Southern Europe, but both of these areas have broken off over the centuries. If you go West or North from Bulgaria you get into Covenant territory. And if you go North or East from Tajikistan and Uzbekistan you get into Communes territory. The Makhzen is bordered on its southern reaches in the old world by World Crime League territory. It is a noticeable source of contention that from the Makhzen's founding lands in Persia you can literally see Afghans who work (albeit unknowingly) for the WCL.

**Probably Established:** 8th century BCE, Persia

### The Covenant
_"A bishop of the Covenant can believe anything, but most of us don't."_

The effect of the Roman Catholic Church on human history is hard to over estimate. As Rome itself was coming crashing down, Europe was largely cut off from the Middle East, Africa, and points further in Asia. Europe became isolated, and the influence of the Makhzen all but vanished. It was at this time that the supernatural creatures of the European region created a new organization modeled on the fledgling Roman Catholic Church.

The Covenant has extremely confused theology and you are specifically not allowed to be excommunicated for heresy. After all, the Covenant's primary role is to facilitate social interaction and conflict resolution between members rather than to advance any specific theological agenda. The Covenant is led by an Anti-Pope who wears a mask and whose identity is nominally secret. The Anti-Pope leads the council of Cardinals, from whom he or she is nominated, and does so for an unspecified amount of time before being replaced - occasionally by themselves in a different mask. Below the cardinals are bishops, below bishops are priests, and everyone else is referred to as "Flock". Other organizations refer to Covenant members derisively as "Sheep".

Law in the Covenant is confusing and pre-baroque, grounded in Roman law and medieval superstition. It is doctrine in the Covenant that canon law is infallible, and thus no law is ever replaced or contradicted. The immense amount of doublethink required to make this function at all is produced by Glossators, who philosophize the inordinately convoluted structures whereby contradictory statements can be rationalized as merely _seeming_ to contradict each other. Canon law itself is crafted by a group of bishops called the Heresiarchs who draft documents for potential Anti-Papal blessing. Who sits on the Heresiarch council at any time is highly variable, as a seat becomes vacant whenever a Heresiarch misses two meetings in a row, and an empty seat is filled as soon as seven bishops not on the council,  three bishops on the council, or the Anti-Pope nominate one of the other Bishops into the seat.

World wide there are about a hundred bishops or bishop equivalents, and the substantial majority are in Europe.

**Probably Established:** 5th century CE, Rome.

### World Crime League
_"Don't tell me that you're innocent. Because it insults my intelligence and it makes me very angry."_

With the encroachment of the Mongols into South and Southeast Asia, the kingdoms remaining outside the Khan's grasp were cut off from trade with the outside world. The supernatural creatures of the region were forced to make their own way, without influence from the old power structures. A pirate navy formed in Southeast Asia, which preyed upon naval traffic and helped fight the Mongol Empire alongside the mortal forces of Emperor Trần Nhân Tông. Keeping themselves on a military, outlaw footing kept the Mongols out of their lands and waters for as long as the Ming dynasty stood, but by the time they had reestablished connections with other Syndicates, the Viet Shadow Kingdom had power of its own and its membership had no real desire to rejoin the Makhzen. They instead took their criminal activities world wide and became the League of Pirates, and eventually the World Crime League.

Because of their piratical roots, the World Crime League has a vaguely naval structure at the top. There is a council of Captains who discuss world issues and update the guidelines. Locally, WCL members infiltrate whatever criminal groups happen to be active in the region and modify themselves appropriately. WCL members have risen to high ranks in Triads, Vory, Mafia, and Ghost Cartels. 

The WCL values money and other trappings of human temporal power as well as mystical power, and one can literally purchase their way up in the ranks of the Syndicate. The group holds that breaking the laws of man and corrupting the values of human society is a goal in and of itself, and undermining the rule of law and morality is seen as a powerful and respectable achievement by the League.

**Probably Established:** 13th century CE, Dai Viet.

### The Cauchemar Communes
_"Tradition is but the illusion of permanence. Change is not just inevitable, it is good."_

Supernatural societies have with necessity been extremely conservative over the generations. And such it was that when the age of enlightenment hit the human world, the supernatural world found itself falling behind. The Cauchemar Communes were founded as a reform movement for the supernatural world to take advantage of the new ideas and opportunities found in human science. The term is French for the common people of the nightmares - which was how non-elder supernatural creatures were thought of in 18th century France. Originally arranged in a "cell structure", the Communes nominally hold that all of their membership is equal, save for the Revolutionary Committee members themselves who are substantially more equal.

The Cauchemar hold that advancements in human strength and society are, or at least can be, for the good of the supernaturals. Rather than viewing the world as shrinking, leaving them with less and less space in which to hide, the Communes view the world as growing with more and more humans and cities with which to obscure themselves. The Communes' understanding of the Vow of Silence is one based largely upon anonymity rather than invisibility.

As a reformist, "bottom up" movement, the Communes have been able to make great inroads in areas that were previously outside Syndicates, and toppled several minor ones (such as the Puppeteers, the Laibon, and the Kingdom of Yomi). Most impressive of their feats was the dismantling and absorption of the Bumin Horde of Ergenekon. The Cauchemar Communes hold a great deal of power in China and many former Soviet Republics, and also in much of the American Midwest, Canada, and France. The Communes hold territory easily containing more human population than any other Syndicate, a fact that is truly frightening to many other Syndicates considering their newness. Despite their European origins, or perhaps because of the proximity of their founding to the capital of the Covenant, the Communes have made little progress in Western Europe. In 1798 it seemed that the Communes were on the brink of sacking the Heresiarch Council and ending the Covenant Church altogether. However, in the coming years the Covenant made a number of reforms and concessions to various bishops and interest groups and held onto their European holdings all the way to the Alps. The Cauchemar ended up signing onto peace and expanding instead into the lands of those Syndicates that refused to adapt.

**Probably Established:** 18th century CE, Pyrenees Mountains.

## Antagonistic Organizations
_"Actually, those guys are just bastards. We fight them."_

What makes an antagonist organization different from a "normal" organization in After Sundown is not that they are "the bad guys" - after all it is abundantly clear that a substantial number of people in _all_ the supernatural societies are _bad guys_. These organizations are filled with blood drinking _monsters_. No, the salient thing about the Antagonists in this setting is that they are not willing to live and let live with the members of other Syndicates and cults. So while it is entirely possible to have a story in which one character is from the Makhzen and another is from the Communes, it is basically impossible to have a cogent story in which one character is in the Marduk Society and the other characters are not.

The assumption then is that the antagonist organizations will be NPC only. The player characters will be members of the standard Syndicates or independents and as such the warriors of the Shattered Empire who show up at all it will do so as enemies. It is entirely possible to play a campaign in which every character is a member of the Marduk society, and that's fine. If you weren't OK with playing a game that skated closely to the edge of evil you wouldn't be playing a game about vampires and werewolves.

However, it's equally important to note that just because the King with Three Shadows may be a _villain_ who is basically _at war_ with the World Crime League, that does not mean that anyone is automatically on kill-on-sight terms with anyone else. Even these antagonistic organizations have diplomatic ties of some sort or another with all of the major Syndicates. These ties are _strained_, and ambassadors are sometimes recalled, but actual shooting wars have causes, beginnings, and negotiated _ends_.

### The Marduk Society
_"We've slain the monsters of the world until they skulk in darkness like rats. Did you really think the darkness would protect you?"_

In ages past the mighty sky wizard Marduk fought with the great Tiamat and slew her, saving humanity from her dark tyranny. As the savior of humanity, Marduk became a wise and just king who ruled over Sumeria thousands of years ago. He passed his magic down to disciples, and in classic fashion they perverted everything Marduk stood for and are now a terrifying edifice.

The Marduk Society retains the ancient magics of Marduk himself and continue to hunt supernaturals, nominally to save humanity from the oppression of supernatural influences. However, the leadership of the Marduk Society actually _are_ supernatural creatures. After ruthlessly hunting down the spawn of Tiamat for generations they found that they were able to grant themselves immortality by eating the flesh of Leviathans, a practice which in reality transforms their elite membership _into_ Leviathans. The sorceries left behind by Marduk are in truth no different from the sorceries of any Witch, and thus it is that the core membership of the Marduk Society are no different from other supernaturals save for the hat they wear and their intense desire to not get along.

Marduk's magic draws heavily upon human fear and suffering to use as power. However, while the historical Marduk apparently used this as justification to wander the lands righting wrongs and saving the endangered, the modern incarnation conspires to make mortal governments oppressive and ruin the lives of children. Ideally they claim that once their war is won they will make all human society utopic, but there is no particular reason to believe this is true.

**Sample Encounter:** A black van pulls up and six men in black suits get out. They are reasonably professional, have tranq guns and heavy pistols and strongly suggest that the protagonists get into the van. A couple of them are even mutants, and it's probably best to not think about how they got that way.

### The King with Three Shadows
_"How nice of you to join us. You can share the same fate they are going to suffer."_

Long ago a powerful mortal king married a queen of the fairies. Abandoning his kingdom of men to wither and die, he took a new name and attained everlasting life with a grim bargain with Demons. A bargain that ultimately hurled his kingdom into the deepest pits of the Dark Reflection. The King with Three Shadows has become as the fairy are, and he lives forever without changing. He is now their dark king, and commands the mirror goblins - an army of fairies and demons which do his dark bidding. He is supported in his endeavors by three powerful Fairies - The Three Shadows of the King.

Fairies and Demons have a difficult time getting to the world of man at all, and must pass through a reflective surface to do so. More powerful fairies and demons need more specific mirrors through which to pass, and thus usually require that these doorways be custom built to draw them through. While a minor mirror goblin might be able to come through a pool of water or a pane of glass, powerful demons need a mirrored surface of exacting specifications - for example one might require a mirror at least 2 meters across made of bronze and polished with olive oil, lemon juice, and human blood.

The King with Three Shadows himself requires a titanic and exacting mirror to again trod upon the Earth, and it is thus that he is forced to send minions through the portals to acquire the strange materials and specific events they need to allow him to march across the threshold with his demonic army to conquer the human world.

**Sample Encounter:** Four mirror goblins are running down the sidewalk of the broad suburban street with an empty sack. As they pass, the streetlights flicker and dim, keeping them in the shadows. If the protagonists follow them, they see the gibbering villains break into a nondescript house and come out again with a struggling sack about the size of a young child. They then clamber back down the street and meep their way into a _different_ house. If still unmolested, they make their way to the bathroom mirror and make good their escape.

### The Shattered Empire
_"They have learned nothing, and they have forgotten nothing."_

According to the Shattered Empire there was once a mighty nation which ruled over all of humanity with magician kings. Where this kingdom actually was, when it existed, who the people were who ran it, and what the cultural traits of it were like are all lost to time. The Shattered Empire calls itself a dozen names: Ur, Atlantis, and Golgatha to name just a few. And while their stories of their glorious days of world ownership are somewhat conflictory, and quite possibly exaggerations or just plain _lies_, they are nonetheless willing to kill people over their world conquest plans. And that makes them dangerous.

The very top of the Empire is called either the Rain King, the Masked Prophet, or the Once and Future Emperor. Whether these are three different people having a power struggle or one man with a variety of titles is not clear. Cells of the Shattered Empire hide in cave systems, deep in jungles, and on top of forbidding mountains. They collect powerful magics and threaten the world with them.

The primary bones of contention between the Shattered Empire and the other Syndicates have to do with rulership. The Empire holds not only that they should rule all the other supernatural creatures like in the old days, but that they should rule all of the humans like in the old days too. And yes, that really does mean _like the old days_. Many of the members of the Empire believe that allowing humans to work bronze was a mistake and that such mistakes should be corrected.

**Sample Encounter:** The meeting is going well enough when it is announced that a messenger has arrived. A confident and wild-eyed Troglodyte strides into the room dressed in a coarse toga and trailed by some mad looking ghosts. He points his claws accusingly at the city officials and makes the pronouncement that The Empire has uncovered "the great bell" and you all have a fortnight to surrender the city. Then he and the ghosts fade into The Gloom.

## Cults
_"Has it ever occurred to you that maybe, just maybe, all the crazy pointless crap we do isn't crazy or pointless?"_

Many magical creatures attempt to increase their magical power by sharing secrets of magic with other supernatural creatures. These mystical filesharing groups serve as secret clubs, religious heresies, and trade guilds. These organizations are semi-secret. While their membership is largely composed of supernatural creatures (whose very existence is a secret from the mundane humans of the world), the specific activities of these groups are kept under wraps even from other supernaturals. 

Each Cult is distinguished largely by 3 things. The first is their **Favored Magic**. This is the path of Sorcery that a character can reasonably expect to be taught by joining and advancing within the cult. The second is the **Favored Resources**. These are two resources that a character gets easily whilst a member of the cult in good standing. Further, the character's status within the cult is in some way enhanced by having lots of these backgrounds. And finally there is the **Work**. This is what the cult _does_ in and around supernatural society. For example, the Ulmi family business is finance and bureaucracy, so other supernaturals frequently hire them to navigate human legalities on their behalf. On the flip side, The Black Hand makes it a point to murder people in cold blood, and supernaturals are rarely above hiring _them_ to hammer down nails judged to be standing up.

A note on how to integrate each Cult's work into your chronicle has been included in each Cult's description. Each group has agendas that are in many ways fairly sketchy - and it is not at all inconceivable that the characters may find themselves working with or against any of them. Indeed, it's highly likely that characters will end up teaming up with and opposing the _same group_ at different times. Cults fit a role somewhere between the Syndicates and purely antagonistic organizations in most chronicles.

While a cult could be as small as a single band, there are a few that span the world, or beyond.
