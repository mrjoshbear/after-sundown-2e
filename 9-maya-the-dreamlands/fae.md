## Fae
_TK_

Covetous and frightening, the Fae of After Sundown are a lot more like the Svartalfs of bloodthirsty Norse myth than the pixies of a Disney cartoon. If they _were_ from a Disney cartoon, it would probably be the Night on Bald Mountain segment from Fantasia.

All Fey have an Astral Power Source and suffer aggravated wounds from iron. Before humanity had iron, there were Fey outposts on Earth: cruel and barbarous slaveholding affairs that sculpted the land to be more like Limbo. When iron came to human hands, the Fey were wiped from the Earth. This historical footnote has been obscured, since of course the obvious parallels possible with other supernatural creatures is enough to give any Covenant Prelate pause.
