## Evil Plants
_"There's no sense in getting killed by a plant."_

The lands of Maya are filled with strange foliage. But strangest of all is the foliage that harbors a deep hatred for people and animals. Possessed of an intelligence that is so wholly unlike those of humanity's that they are difficult to measure, these plants are condemned universally as being "Evil" even by the jaded standards of supernatural society. Completely emotionless, Evil Plants are not motivated by passions and cannot be induced to frenzy nor convinced against a course of action with emotional argument of any kind.

### Creepers
_"It waits till weâ€™re weak before it reveals its strength."_

Creepers are the weakest of the Evil Plants, but are subtle and insidious nonetheless. The real body of the creeper is a system of interlocking rhizomatic roots that lie underground or parasitically buried into other plants that emerge only to creep their way into weakened prey. From these roots spring a myriad of possible forms, most commonly brightly colored flowering vines or apparent patches of beautiful wild flowers. Disturbing these flowers subjects the area to clouds of sticky poison that (most commonly) drives everyone in the area to hallucinatory madness as the vines and roots begin their slow emergence to trap them in place.

Creepers are obviously quite dangerous to cultivate, but sometimes people try anyway as they can be coaxed into producing particular poisons (instead of a ready supply of hallucinogens) or reagents useful in Bitter Fruit recipes.

Creepers have a nonstandard attribute array because they were never humans. Creepers have no Agility or ability to move outside of using Grass Rope to extend parts of themselves or the plants that they exist alongside and have no personalities to exercise Charisma, but very old and well-fed Creepers could resemble a forest of mangroves or aspens more than a cluster of vines. Before their Potency modifier their attribute ranges are:

S: 1/12 A: 0/0 I: 5/10 L: 1/1 W: 1/6 C: 0/0

A Creeper has an Astral power source and a Feeding power schedule - any lost power points are restored by consuming bodies. As with other Evil Plants they are vulnerable to iron and weakened by alcohol - spraying an area down can prevent them from extending their roots until it evaporates.

### Mantraps
_"Feed Me!"_

Mantraps are essentially Aubrey the monster from Little Shop of Horrors or the carnivorous plants from Mario Brothers. They are able to move their giant mouth quite quickly, but they are rooted to the ground and cannot effectively give chase. Brutally effective ambush hunters, Mantraps try to eat animals whenever the opportunities arise.

Mantraps can't readily transport themselves across the land, let alone the borders between the dreamlands and the material world. Nevertheless, they do appear on Earth, because there are those who for whatever reason dig them up and transplant them. They often appear as guard plants in Marduk Society compounds. Mantraps can learn to speak, and their muppet-like countenance creates alien voices.

The huge woody maw of a Mantrap is a damage 3 weapon, and, yes, it does count as wood for the purpose of supernatural vulnerabilities. Mantraps have a nonstandard attribute array because they were never humans. Before their Potency modifier their attribute ranges are:

S: 3/8 A: 4/7 I: 4/10 L: 4/6 W: 5/11 C: 4/7

A Mantrap has an Astral power source and a Feeding power schedule. As Evil Plants they are vulnerable to iron and weakened by alcohol.

### Triffids
_"I dunno what the hell's in there, but it's weird and pissed off, whatever it is."_

The Triffids are mobile plant monsters that are only vaguely describable as humanoid in shape. Like other Evil Plants, they need meat in their diet, but unlike the others they can get up and walk at a normal speed. As such, Triffids are not relegated to ambush hunting, they can seriously chase their prey down and eat them. And they do.

A Triffid has a poison barb on the end of each meter long tendril that extends from their maw. Some of them sprout leaves and/or flowers from various parts of their body. Some of them are instead smooth like an ivy vine or wrinkled like a redwood tree. It's not entirely clear what the significance of that distinction is.

The vicious barbed tendrils of a Triffid constitute a damage 3 weapon that can deliver the poison of the Triffid's "bite". Triffids have a nonstandard attribute array because they were never humans. Before their Potency modifier their attribute ranges are:

S: 7/12 A: 4/7 I: 6/10 L: 4/6 W: 5/11 C: 4/7

A Triffid has an Astral power source and a Lunar power schedule. As Evil Plants they are vulnerable to iron and weakened by alcohol.

### Pods
_"There are others... they'll stop you!"<br >
"In an hour, you won't want them to."_

The Pods are psychic hazards that take over people and use them to make more pods and take more people over. It's a rather disturbing pyramid scheme, and it is not uncommon for even the Marduk Society and the Communes to work together in order to unravel Pod cults. It's not especially clear what it is that Pods _want_, but whatever it is, they appear to have no intention of discussing it with any political structures from the material world.

Each pod is roughly the size of a large watermelon and appears to be a massive green potato. Most pods have some milk white tendrils growing out of what is most probably the bottom. These look similar to the rootlets that grow out of a potato if you leave it in water for a long period of time. There are slight depressions all over the Pod that appear to be its "eyes" - they are able to see things through them and use Authority on victims who look at them. The tendrils of a Pod can only move by growing over the course of minutes and hours, so for any practical purposes they are essentially immobile. Pods have a nonstandard attribute array because they were never humans. Before their Potency modifier their attribute ranges are:

S: 1/1 A: 0/0 I: 5/12 L: 5/12 W: 5/12 C: 4/10

A Pod has an Astral power source and a Lunar power schedule. As Evil Plants they are vulnerable to iron and weakened by alcohol.
