# Attributes and Skills

## Basic Attributes: Physical, Mental, and Social

Characters in After Sundown have six basic attributes that are divided into Physical, Mental, and Social attributes. These basic attributes range in value between 4 and 9 for normal humans.

**Physical Attributes:**
* **Strength:** Strength determines how physically strong _and_ tough you are.
* **Agility:** Agility is a combination of precision and speed.

**Mental Attributes**
* **Awareness:** Awareness is a combination of empathic and physical perception.
* **Intellect:** Intellect is a combination of problem-solving know-how and logical intelligence.

**Social Attributes**
* **Willpower:** Willpower is a combination of determination and domination.
* **Charisma:** Charisma is one's ability to convince and ingratiate.

The primary purpose of basic attributes is to set the dicepools for actions. A character with a high Agility will have a bunch of extra dice to roll for every skill test that invokes Agility. A character with a high Charisma will have extra dice on every test that uses Charisma, and so on. A character's basic attributes represent a broad aptitude in a wide variety of actions.

### Special Attributes: Edge, Fate, Potency and Power Points

**Edge** is a measure of narrative importance that Luminaries have. Extras have an Edge of zero, while Luminaries have an Edge of at least 1, and usually 3 or sometimes higher.

An important thing that Edge also does is that it adds to Resistance Rolls. Whenever an ability says that the target resists with their Strength or Willpower (or whatever) you can assume that it means "plus Edge if the target is a Luminary and actually has an Edge stat", sort-of as if it were a Skill for generally resisting harm and other unwanted effects.

Every two points of Edge a character has increases the absolute maximum they can raise their skills to during play. While characters start with skill ratings of 6 or less, a character with an Edge of 2 or 3 can eventually raise them to 7, while a character with an Edge of 4 or 5 could raise their skills to 8. A character with an Edge of 6 can potentially get a skill of 9. Six is the maximum Edge for any character (regardless of Potency, as it is a special attribute).

**Fate** is a measure of the fluid benefit Edge provides until it runs out. You can spend it in a few ways:

* You can reroll all the dice on a test that didn't get a hit.
* You can add a number of extra dice to a test equal to your Edge score. If penalties would reduce your normal dice pool to zero or less then you can spend an Edge to try anyway with dice equal to your Edge score.
* You can dodge out of the way of an attack or other danger without using your action, or after you've already acted in a round.
* You can "escape" an otherwise lethal situation in a narratively appropriate way. At this point you are having fate intervene to save you in a narratively plausible fashion. This will require a negotiation of some kind with the MC to determine what is plausible under the circumstances. Maybe it's the police showing up before the Trolls have the opportunity to put the boot in, maybe it's the floor collapsing and dumping your comatose character into the basement before the flames have an opportunity to burn them to death. It is advisable that a character being saved in such a manner be inconvenienced in some fashion. It's intended as a last ditch save-your-ass moment, not something to be smugly relied upon.

Fate refreshes between chronicles or when you make progress on a Driving Goal. You do not have to spend Fate to get bonus dice Edge provides when soaking a stab wound or resisting mental domination - the extra Edge dice for Resistance Tests are automatic and free. 

**Potency** When a character's powers increase they may get a special attribute called _Potency_. A character's Potency is added to the _maximum_ (but not necessarily the actual value) of each of their Physical, Mental, and Social attributes, and every point of Potency increases their maximum Power Points by 3. Normal humans have a Potency of zero. Some spawn and other weak supernatural creatures (such as Mirror Goblins) have a Potency of one. Starting supernatural creatures of a playable type such as Vampires or Witches have a Potency of 2. This rating gradually rises as the creature ages and grows in eldritch power, and can rise quite abruptly by slaying powerful elders [Highlander](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091203/) style, or by attuning to powerful artifacts, completing mighty rituals of vast power, or otherwise reaching the kinds of breakpoints in a story in which a monster might become nearly unstoppable. The most powerful named characters in the setting (such as The King with Three Shadows or Echidna) have a Potency of 10, and player characters can expect to have a Potency much, much lower than that.

Potency limits the Powers that a character has access to. With potency 1 character has access to only Basic Powers. A Potency of 2 or higher grants access to Advanced powers. With a potency of 3 or more comes access to Elder powers, which would otherwise be limited to great and terrible ritual or myth. Most characters are limited to no more than one Elder power per additional point of Potency.

Such power has its price. Any character with a Potency of 1 or greater (and some that don't) are ruled by a Master Passion, an emotional flaw that subjects them to uncontrollable frenzy. Each additional point of Potency deepens this price by requiring a Disadvantage, starting with the Distinctive Flaw of their particular type, and from there usually developing in related but individualistic ways.

_Genevra is a Vampire with Potency 1. This means that her **maximum** value for raising her Agility, Willpower, and other attributes is 7. Six maximum for having started as a human, plus her Potency of 1. Her maximum Power Reserve is 13 (10 + 3*1)._

| Potency | Power Points | Attribute Max | Power Limit | Consequences |
|--------:|-------------:|--------------:|:------------|:-------------|
|       - |            0 |             9 | none        | none         |
|       1 |           10 |            10 | Basic       | Master Passion |
|       2 |           13 |            11 | Advanced    | Master Passsion and Distinctive Flaw |
|       3 |           16 |            12 | Elder       | Master Passion, Distinctive Flaw, and 1 additional Disadvantage |
|      +1 |           +3 |            +1 | Elder       | +1 additional Disadvantage |

**Power Points** in After Sundown are a special fluid attribute similar to Fate. Power Points are generally spent to activate specific supernatural abilities that a character might have. Power Points by themselves do not refresh. Characters will have things to do with their Power Points and ways to refresh it if they are a supernatural creature, called their Power Schedule. Characters have a **maximum** Power at any given time of 7 points plus 3 points per point of Potency. This means that most player characters (who have a Potency of 1) will have their Power Reserve fill up at 13. Mortals and other Potency 0 creatures have a Power Point maximum of 10, but likely have no ability or reason to acquire Power Points.

_Example: Genevra is a Vampire with the Quickness ability from the Power of Celerity. As a vampire, she has the Vigor ability from the Clout discipline, and can spend Power Points to increase her Strength for a scene. In addition, she can spend a Power Point to take extra actions during a scene with her Celerity discipline. Because she is a vampire, she can refresh her Power Points by drinking blood from other people._

There is one generic way Power Points can be spent: you can spend Power Points up to your Potency to add dice to any Resistance Roll against a supernatural power.

## Using Attributes Without Skills
_"Granted, but I'm still huge."_

Characters in After Sundown may be called upon to use skills when they don't actually have training in that area. In this case, the character is called upon to _default_ on the skill. This allows the character to roll a dicepool of their appropriate Attribute (plus zero dice for not having the skill). When defaulting on a Social or Technical Skill, the character suffers an additional -1 die  penalty for being untrained. When using Technical Skills, that same -1 die penalty applies whenever the character doesn't have an appropriate specialization (even if they _do_ have the appropriate skill). In other cases, the appropriate skill might be some sort of Background, which should generally be interpreted broadly.

There are a few of times when you will want to do something for which _no_ skill, active or background, applies. In that case a mere attribute roll may suffice (obviously with no -1 die penalty). But remember that dice pools without skills are substantially _smaller_ than dicepools with skills attached - so in most cases the MC should try to figure out a way to fit a skill in. Resistance Tests are a special case of this, since Luminaries get to add their Edge to the roll instead of a skill, and Extras are meant to be easy to affect.

### Sure Things: Heavy Lifting
_"Sure, sometimes you can do all kinds of stuff. But I can **always** lift a car."_

There are things you don't have to roll because they simply _are_. A character with a high Charisma _is_ charming, a character with a high Logic _is_ smart. Even if they offend someone or fail to solve a problem, they will do so in a charming or intelligent fashion. But probably the thing you will run into most frequently as far as automatic uses of Attributes is Strength. People who have a high Strength _are strong_, and they can lift heavy things. So to help out with that, here's a table of how much a character might be able to push themselves to lift up, and how much they might be able to carry home without hurting themselves.

| Strength | Max Lift (Kg) | Carry (Kg) | Max Lift (Lb) | Carry (Lb) |
|:--------:|--------------:|-----------:|--------------:|-----------:|
| 1 | 30 | 10 | 66 | 22 |
| 2 | 50 | 20 | 110 | 44 |
| 3 | 100 | 30 | 210 | 66 |
| 4 | 150 | 50 | 330 | 110 |
| 5 | 250 | 70 | 550 | 155 |
| 6 | 450 | 100 | 990 | 220 |
| 7 | 750 | 200 | 1,650 | 440 |
| 8 | 1,250 | 500 | 2,750 | 1,100 |
| 9 | 2,500 | 1,000 | 5,500 | 2,200 |
| 10 | 5,000 | 2,000 | 11,000 | 4,400 |
| 11 | 7,000 | 3,000 | 15,400 | 6,600 |
| 12 | 10,000 | 4,500 | 22,000 | 10,000 |
| 13 | 14,000 | 6,000 | 31,000 | 13,000 |
| 14 | 20,000 | 8,000 | 44,000 | 17,500 |
| 15 | 28,000 | 10,000 | 62,000 | 22,000 |
| 20 | 60,000 | 24,000 | 132,000 | 53,000 |
| 25 | 100,000 | 40,000 | 220,000 | 88,000 |
| 30 | 150,000 | 60,000 | 330,000 | 132,000 |
| 35 | 200,000 | 80,000 | 441,000 | 176,000 |

And yes, things that are really strong are _really strong_. A creature with a strength of 35 can lift a _train_ right off the track. Although they can only do this by lifting one car at a time and can't really walk off with it. Consider the scene in [King Kong](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0024216/) where the giant ape (who in After Sundown would be a Kaiju) pulls a train off the tracks by lifting a car and dropping the whole thing. That's not an exaggeration, in After Sundown the giant apes can actually do those things.

## Skills
_No one may ever know if what you did was good or bad, but you did it well._

A key portion of the die roll for any test is the _skill_. It represents _specific_ training that helps a character perform a task. And because of that, it can lead to a far amount of confusion among some people, because linguistically we refer both to people who are very good at something and also people who are good at a wide variety of things as being "skilled". In After Sundown, skills are basically confined to the former interpretation. Jacks of All Trades are represented game mechanically by people who have relatively high _attributes_ and low skills. People with high skills are specialists by definition.

### Specializations
_This is what I'm good at. And I'm the best. You might ask: 'what good is that'? And the answer is that being the best at anything makes you the best at something._

A specialization is a subset of a skill that a character is especially proficient in. When they make tests using the skill in a manner that is relevant to their interests, they gain 2 extra dice in their dice pool. Technical skills are an inherently specialized field, so in addition to getting 2 extra dice within a character's specialties, Technical Skill dicepools are _penalized_ by 1 die if they are being used outside a relevant specialization.

The sample specializations are by no means comprehensive, and players should work out with their MC to find or create specializations that are right for them. A character might have their Sabotage specialized in Eco-Terrorism covering both spiking trees (that might more frequently go under "traps") _and_ breaking a bulldozer (that might more frequently go under "Disabling Stuff"). Another character might have their Animal Ken specialized in Horses, covering the training, breeding, and calming of wild and domestic horses. 

The MC should take care to make sure that no specialization is universally useful. Specializing a skill in something that would apply in all cases is basically the same as just getting 2 points in the skill, and that's unfair. MCs must be expected to reject specializing Combat in "fighting" or specializing Bureaucracy in "paperwork." A character can have more than one specialization in the same skill, and this is often very important for Technical skills. If more than one Specialization would apply, the character still only gets 2 bonus dice.

## Physical Skills

Physical skills involve doing stuff with your body. Since everyone has a body, the defaulting penalty for using physical skills untrained is zero. Without specialized training you can always still make a raw attribute test. A very strong person can grapple fairly effectively on that basis alone, an intuitive person can easily notice things, and so on and so forth.

### Athletics

Athletics is the skill you use to run, jump, climb, swim, throw things, and generally do everything that you're vaguely expected to do in PE except sneak into the girl's locker room and get shamed by your peers. Most stunts are athletics based, and it can even be useful in attacking enemies in combat by dint of throwing things at specific targets.

**Specializations:** Climb, Jump, Run, Swim, Throwing

### Combat

Combat is the training needed to fight. Usually other people. More than any other skill, people will ask to divide up Combat into smaller fragments. It is not immediately clear why, but we strongly suggest that you do not do this. While there are truly a vast array of differences between stabbing someone with a sword and shooting them with a gun - the simple fact that the combat simulationist player can _name_ them all draws attention to how simply not that different they are. The basic truths of combat skill include making rapid life and death decisions while avoiding threats and putting the pointy end of your weapon into the other man. There's a world of differences from combat situation to combat situation, and that's why the skill goes all the way to six. But please remember that this is a game where flying a plane and managing a nuclear power plant can be the same skill (Operations).

**Specializations:** By weapon or martial style.

### Drive

Drive allows people to drive culturally appropriate vehicles. For people in the west, that's mostly just cars. But for people in river areas or fishing communities, that's often small boats as well. Driving under safe conditions is such a banal and non-awesome thing, that characters do not need to actually make rolls to do it, so players may not even need the skill. But when it comes to dangerous driving conditions, car chases, or even just cutting commute times, rolls are generally required, and having the skill is helpful. This dichotomy is generally why in movies cars wipe out spectacularly the moment someone uses magic to create icy road conditions - a lot of people on the road are legitimately terrible drivers, and the moment things get harsh they become one of the 18,000 car accidents that happen every day in the US. 

A character can drive a new non-standard type of vehicle for every rating point and specialization of the skill they have. Common choices are emergency vehicles, motor boats, construction equipment, armored vehicles, light aircraft, and oversized (semis and buses), but really players can pretty much go nuts. Any plane or ship which is piloted with dials and knobs rather than a wheel or stick is the domain of Operations rather than Drive.

**Specializations:** Bad Weather, Aggressive Driving, Cross Town Traffic, Navigation

### Larceny

Characters skilled at Larceny are adept at working outside the law. It is a broad skill that covers lots of dubious activities, from identifying and bypassing security systems to picking other peoples' pockets. There is some overlap between Larceny and Rigging when dealing with locks. Locks are both geared puzzles and a basic hindrance to breaking into places. This is a good skill to have for security workers in addition to criminals. You gotta know your enemy if you're gonna win the war. 

**Specializations:** Concealing Goods, Legerdemain, Lockpicking, Security Systems

### Perception

Perception is the skill by which a character perceives the world around themselves. It is used to spot clues, notice subtle noises, and smell unfortunate smells. Characters with very low Perceptions are the characters who do not notice monsters sneaking up on them or have to have the meaning or import of subtle clues explained to them by other protagonists.

**Specializations:** By sense, Investigation, Noticing sneaking

### Stealth

The Stealth skill is what one uses to avoid being noticed, either by moving quietly, becoming unseen against the background, or simply blending into the crowd. Whenever a character is being searched for, a Stealth check can be used to make that searching more difficult. Stealth involves using what is available, so there is almost no circumstance in which it cannot be used to at least postpone the moment that a character is noticed.

**Specializations:** Hiding, Innocuity, Shadowing, Sneaking

### Survival

100% of the creatures alive today are the descendants of an unbroken line of ancestors who were all able to survive in their environment long enough to have had children that extends back to when single celled organisms had only two different nucleotides in their DNA. So persisting in the face of adversity is something that creatures have a birthright to. And yet, adversity has also kept up with the times. Survival is the skill of keeping up with the elements.

One can also make Survival checks to scavenge things of a more modern nature. A Survival check could be called for to loot useful things out of a junk yard or to track the layout of a sewer system.

**Specializations:** Tracking, Gathering, Shelter, by Environment.

## Social Skills

Regular socialization is performed with Backgrounds, rather than social skills. If you want to ingratiate yourself with others, track down the word on the street, or otherwise perform social legwork, you probably want to use a background like _High Society_ or _Barrio_. Social skills apply a -1 dicepool penalty when defaulting.

### Animal Ken

Dealing with inhuman beasts is a skill in and of itself. Neither lions nor sheep really have any backgrounds, and the Animal Ken skill is used in their place. Animal Ken is used to read the emotions of an animal as well as to calm one down or train it to do stuff. Animal Ken is thus your one-stop-shop for all socialization with dogs, which considering how much less a dog knows than any human or supernatural about important plot points, is not nearly as overpowered as you might think

**Specializations:** Domestic Animals, Training, Wild Animals, Riding.

### Bureaucracy

Managing logistics and patiently untangling skeins of red tape is the focus of this skill. Characters can understand and manipulate laws, navigate management systems, and correctly formulate formal requests. Bureaucracy is of use whether the character is attempting to perform bureaucratic tasks and of equal utility when confronted by the implacable edifice of a Kafkaesque course. It is not unusual for people to resent bureaucracy, because it is annoying. But as anyone who has done logistics under any circumstances can tell you, _not_ having rules, management, and records in place is _even worse_.

**Specializations:** Business, Government, Logistics

### Empathy

Empathy is our primary means of interpreting the meaning of actions and inactions of other people. It is a trainable sense of how others are feeling given how they look, what they say, and what they do. Empathy is of obvious use to people like lawyers and police, but it is also an important skill for batters in baseball. It is not merely about figuring out whether someone is being truthful when they are talking, but also about determining what someone is about to do in the physical world.

**Specializations:** Motivation Determination, Detecting Lies, Action Anticipation

### Expression

Expression is the art of entertaining and changing peoples' minds through art. Lots of people think that this can only be accomplished by making movies about gay cowboys eating pudding, but the truth is that _any_ art that provokes the audience to even acknowledge it is on some level influencing the audience. 

**Specializations:** Writing, Dance, Music, Oratory

### Intimidation

Intimidation is the art of using fear to get other people to believe or do things desired of them. Intimidation can be explicit ("If you don't do X, I will stab you. In the face.") or implied ("Did you hear that the feds caught Ted for his tax non-payment? He's going to be doing _time_.") and the threats can be to the target's person, finances, or reputation. And some of the best Intimidation is actually phrased in a manner that implies that some third party will do some thing to the target and the Intimidating character is willing to help _the target_.

**Specializations:** Interrogation, Fear Mongering, Skulduggery, Blackmail

### Persuasion

Persuasion is the art of manipulating people in such a manner that it isn't immediately obvious that is what you're doing. People who are skilled at Persuasion are essentially good at _lying_, although many of them get offended if you call it that. They may prefer the term _acting_ or _sales_.

**Specializations:** Acting, Insinuation, Fast Talk

### Tactics

Tactics is the skill that governs leadership in both the military and corporate sense of the term. Characters can inspire others to give 100% or produce a battle plan. The dragon crawls on its belly, and Tactics dovetails closely with Bureaucracy in the plotting of war, whether genuine or metaphorical. The tactical aspect involves actually maneuvering and the orders necessary to get others to do that - in contrast to the simple appeals to rules or potentially complex logistical management of Bureaucracy.

**Specializations:** Inspiration, Maneuvers, Naval, Siege

## Technical Skills

Technical skills apply the -1 penalty for defaulting if a character doesn't have an appropriate specialization. That is, a character may have Artisan (Painting), but they will still have to default when welding. A character who becomes trained in any Technical skill gains a specialization in that skill for free. A character can't have a specialization in a skill they don't have any ranks in.

### Artisan

The Artisan skill is used when you want to produce a physical object of some level of workmanship - whether you’re going for aesthetic quality or simple utility. 

There are a few more specializations in Artisan than in most Technical skills, in no small part because there are many materials that involve wildly different skills. It is recommended that these specializations are taken as applying to Artisan uses that are "close enough" - so a calligrapher might use the Painting specialization since in both cases they’re applying pigments to surfaces. 

**Specializations:** By Medium (Painting, Sculpture, Metalwork, Carpentry, etc.)

### Electronics

Electronics is the skill used to make the tools of modernity go. Everything from toasters to computers uses electronics to function. And a character with the electronics _skill_ can figure out how it functions and alter it.

**Specializations:** Wiring, Software, Repair, Hacking

### Medicine

Medicine is the art of treating injury and illness to promote good health. Characters use this skill to patch injuries in their pets and team mates. Remember that the realm of horror runs on movie physics, meaning that characters who receive proper medical care are able to make impressive and full recoveries from amazing injuries.

**Specializations:** Veterinary, First Aid, Long Term Care, Psychiatric

### Operations

Operations is the skill of making machines and systems go. One part mechanical engineering and one part heavy machinery operation. This is distinct from _making_ machines (generally artisan), running computer programs that make systems go for you (generally electronics), or driving (generally driving). You make an Operations test when there is _not_ a 1:1 correspondence between your muscle movement and the action of the machine. So it's Operations to pilot a boat and Driving to walk a mech around.

**Specializations:** Piloting, Industry, Repair

### Research

Knowing things is important, but the fact is that your brain probably can't hold all the information you might possibly want to have available - and doesn't always keep the things you do know readily accessible. When you need information that you don't actually have in your head, you can use the Research skill to go look it up. 

Researching things overall is fairly uniform, but there are particular methods of looking things up that might not be obvious to people who don't use that system in particular. Specialization in Archives indicates an ability to look up information in data logs, newspaper histories, and other chronological information stores. The Library specialization involves looking up information in stores classified by content, and data mining covers sifting through Internet searches, wikis, and highly disorganized information for something useful. 

**Specializations:** Archives, Library, Data Mining, Interrogation

### Rigging

Rigging is the skill of MacGyvering and Rube Goldberging things. It is the skill of practical and impromptu engineering. Including lockpicking, plumbing, and clockwork. Rigging is used for most non-electric jury rigging as well as the creation, operation, and repair of most steam punk technologies. 

**Specializations:** Fluids, Gears, Ropes and Pulleys

### Sabotage

Sabotage is the art of breaking stuff in a manner which will be most effective. Sabotage can be used for "rigging things to explode" rather than the actual Rigging skill. Sabotage can be used to break things in such a way as to make them look not broken, to not break things in such a manner as they do look broken, and to make things break in such a manner as to explode. Remember that events in After Sundown have a pyrotechnics budget, so things tend to explode big.

**Specializations:** Explosives, Disabling Stuff, Structural Weaknesses, Traps

## Backgrounds
_You need to have knowledge to get knowledge._

A character's background skills can be literally anything. They represent areas of the game that a character can potentially do legwork in. That is to say that during a chronicle a character may find a clue (such as a strange shape on a video feed from outside a crime scene, a discarded heroin needle, or a tuft of fur), and background skills are methods a character could have to research that clue and gain more information. Background skills are ways for the players to transform story seeds into additional exposition.

Characters can personally know _any_ isolated fact or individual person within the context of the story without there needing to be a notation on the character sheet or die roll involved. You don't need to have a background in evolutionary biology to know that humans are closest related to chimps of all the other great apes - you just need to be told that fact directly or indirectly by someone who _does_ have such a background. But to actually evaluate the research, you need to understand the power and limitations of the methods and the kinds of results that have also been achieved. 

Backgrounds are divided into how one interacts with them. **Academic** Backgrounds are ones in which the character can "go look something up." They often dovetail nicely with the Research, Perception, or Bureaucracy skills. Sciences, ancient languages, classical art, and so forth make good Academic Backgrounds. **Social** Backgrounds are ones where the character "goes to talk to some people." They often dovetail nicely with Social skills like Empathy or Persuasion. Any social group can and does represent a potential Social Background. **Occult** Backgrounds are ones that involve the character "going to do something secret." What skills are helpful for this kind of legwork are highly variable, because Occult Backgrounds are a very variable category. Many Occult Backgrounds are literally magical in origin (such as _Marduk Society Histories_ or _Tarot Readings_), while others are simply secret for a variety of other reasons (legality, morality, or whatever). The defining point of Occult Backgrounds is that telling other people that you have them jeopardizes your ability to use them. The first rule about ghost cartels is the same as the first rule about fight club.

It is frequently important for purposes of socialization whether or not characters have "the same" background or not. Characters who have the same Background automatically have shared interests that they can talk about. However, game mechanically, Backgrounds _do not_ have to have exactly the same name to be "the same." And two Backgrounds that are "the same" in one instance may be "different" in another. A Background is "the same" if in the current instance it covers essentially the same stuff. If one character had _Triads_ and another character had _San Francisco Crime_ as a Background, the two characters would be on wholly common ground when discussing San Francisco's triad operations, and would be speaking Greek or Martian to each other if the conversation changed to Hong Kong triads or San Francisco's IRA network.

It is up to the MC to determine what constitutes an acceptable Background for the campaign. In general however, it is better to err on the side of Backgrounds that are too useful than ones that are too narrow. While it _is_ overpowered for a character to have a Background that applies in virtually (or actually) all circumstances like "Stuff" or "Trivia", the worst thing that's going to happen under such a circumstance is that the player is going to roleplay a lot and move the plot forward. That's not fair to the other characters (unless they are doing the same), but that's still better than the players feeling powerless and having the story stagnate.

### Languages

Languages work much like Backgrounds and can be used just like them in many cases; if you know French you can at least practice with someone else that knows French, and at higher levels you've probably read some of the same authors, watched the same shows, or listened to the same speeches, because those are the things that are used to teach languages. A single point in a language is enough to generally get by with a dictionary, the level possessed by a skilled traveler or an academic working through scholarly articles. Two points is broad fluency, and three is near-native level. A rating of 4 or more represents broad general learning in the spoken and literary culture of a language.

Effectively, the character's effective rating in other Social skills and Backgrounds is limited by the language they converse or write in: they have all of the eloquence imparted by their Persuasion and Backgrounds with their native language, and otherwise their effective rating is limited to _twice_ their rating in the language they are using, so 3 points is generally enough unless you're pushing the human limits of a skill.

Language Backgrounds allow the character to know that language personally. A character does not specifically need to know a language in order to get something translated. The ability to conjure up simple phrases such as "¿Donde está el baño?" or "Lehněte a svlekněte se prosím." is free. Some time with an automated translation can get you a humorously inaccurate translation of many pieces of text (especially short text). And given some time, many Contacts or Intelligence Resources can translate specific languages on your behalf.

### Sample Backgrounds
_Trust me, I've seen stuff like this before._

The completely open ended nature of Backgrounds can be paralyzing when it comes to actual character creation. A blank page can be filled up with _anything_, but frequently it isn't. So to help with that, here are some examples of backgrounds that some of the characters from the Persona Non Grata chapter have and some descriptions of things they use them for in their chronicles.

### Social Backgrounds

Support Groups: Harley did not have an easy childhood and that lead into a messy young adulthood and a lot of legally mandated treatment represented by the Support Groups Background. After hearing kids talking about an addict missing from their neighborhood, Harley's player thinks to go find the nearest church basement and check in with the group leaders to see if they know the person. After taking some time to figure out what groups the person attended (Intuition + Support Groups) she gets them to open up and break anonymity to give her some leads. When she needs a place to lay low for a while or just find new friends in a city she heads there to chat people up with Friendly Banter (Charisma + Support Groups).

Truckin': Jack spends a lot of time on the road and on the radio talkin' to other truckers, and this is represented by his Truckin Background. This means that he has an encyclopedic knowledge of rest stops all up and down the 101. So when he gets a time frame for when the van presumably lightened its load, he can make a very accurate guess (Logic + Truckin) about where to start looking for the bodies. When he is listening to someone's description of their journey to Walnut Creek, he notices (Intuition + Truckin) a discrepancy in their story.

Bar Scene: Dean goes out drinking frequently to attempt to forget the hole in his soul, and this justifies his Bar Scene Background. The team needs a decoy, so Dean goes off to the roadhouse to go pick up an extra woman for that purpose (Willpower + Bar Scene). Later on, they need to track down a fishy poker game, so he asks around (Charisma + Bar Scene).

Kink Scene: Mr. Eaten's main social outings are to kink events, where he can easily go by an alias and cameras are carefully limited. When looking for appropriate prey he watches how people react to scenes (Intuition + Kink Scene) to see if they might be amenable to his tastes. When moving in to converse with a likely candidate (Charisma + Kink Scene) his understanding of the customs and protocols of the scene make things go smoothly.

### Academic Backgrounds

Psychiatry: Harley was an accomplished psychiatrist before her transformation, and thus it is reasonable for her to have the Psychiatry background. After interviewing a man that witnessed a Poltergeist attack she needs to throw the police off the trail. So Marionette throws out a plausible sounding Psychiatric explanation for the cops to eat up and spread as rumor (Willpower + Psychiatry). Later when she's trying to understand the trauma of a Wraith her (Intuition + Empathy) test has a very low Threshold.

Cars and Trucks: Jack knows all about things on the roads. So when it comes time to research up the DMV registration on the kidnappers' van, Jack grabs it and gets an answer for certain, because he knows that he is looking for a 2005 Charcoal Dodge Sprinter. But later on, he reaches for something to talk to the guys at Pizza Hog about, and cars seems like as good a topic as any. And since there are some other gear heads, it works out and he uses it as a Friendly Banter (Charisma + Cars and Trucks) platform.

Ballistics: Dean may not seem that bright, but he does know his way around firearms, and this interest is represented by his Ballistics Background. Not only can he talk for hours to gun enthusiasts about caliber and grains, but he can perform the kind of scientific forensic investigation that a ballistics expert might be called upon for. When he picks up the supposed murder weapon, he immediately notices (Intuition + Ballistics) that something is wrong because the armor piercing bullets in the magazine should have exit wounds on the corpse. Later he measures out the probable point of origin from the bullets and gets a fix on the shooter's location (Logic + Ballistics). And when they have the specs on the enchanted rifle and Dean wants to look up what kind of weapon they are dealing with, he just does it because his Background knowledge pushes the Research threshold down to zero.

Fire Investigation: since he uses fire magic Mr. Eaten has been cramming information on how arsons and other fires are investigated, although he's only picked up a little so far. After using his powers to incinerate a target he tries to clean up the scene and his basic knowledge means that he has a standard threshold to cover up evidence (Logic + Sabotage).

### Occult Backgrounds

Joker Gang: Harley spent a long time as a lieutenant to a boss that terrorized Gotham which amounts to her Joker Gang background. When she needs some explosives she calls up an old friend to get them (Charisma + Joker Gang), and when reports come in of a "vault heist" come in she is able to go through the details and identify it as a feint (Logic + Joker Gang) because she knows how to break into a vault and what people are looking for in them. 

Chinese Monsters: Jack has put up with a lot of bullshit from the Eastern wing of the Shattered Empire, and he knows his long haired ghosts from his thundering witches. During the investigations, he meets up with The Peach Lady, and needing something to talk about, he reaches for supernatural stuff from her homeland. This is an acceptable form of Friendly Banter (Charisma + Chinese Monsters), and seemingly gets the immortal beauty to open up to him. Later on, he comes face to face with an Asian Leviathan and identifies it as such (Logic + Chinese Monsters).

Hell Mouths: Dean has been in and out of the Dark Reflection many times, and this is reflected in his Hell Mouths Background. As they are searching the house, Dean notices (Intuition + Hell Mouths) that the bathroom mirror has been used as a portal, and fairly recently by the ashen smell. When the team finds itself outside the Iron Tower, Dean falls on his knowledge of hell mouth locations to plan a route back to the mortal world (Logic + Hell Mouths).
