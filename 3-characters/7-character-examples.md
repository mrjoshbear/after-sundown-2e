## Character Examples

### Sample Character Creation

TK

### I Want To Be...

### A Dracula

Start with a Strigoi Vampire. For your sample starting powers go with a mix of Call of the Wild powers (Beast Form to turn into a wolf or bat, Tongue of Beasts and the Beckoning to command wolves, rats, and bats) and Clout powers like War Form and Monstrous self to turn into a brutal killing machine. Or grab an Authority power to build off of Mesmerism.

### A Lost Boy Vampire

Camazotz are suited to this and they can already fly and be stylish. Look into Veil of Morpheus powers, especially Phantasmagoria, to round out your bag of tricks. The Attractive Advantage works great with this type of role.

### An Interviewable Vampire

Strigoi for this one. You're easily able to add Authority and Discernment powers for mind reading and control (Mesmerism and Telepathy work very well together), and you can grab fun one-offs like Clinging or Flight to round out the power set.

### A Buffy Vampire

Nosferatu all the way. Just activate War Form whenever you vamp-out, and you're already good to go.

### Mr. Hyde / The Hulk

Icarid is a great choice for this; just pick up War Form and/or Monstrous self to represent your killing machine self, and maybe grab Revive the Flesh and/or Restoration to become unkillable.

### The Invisible Man

Icarid again. This time go with the Play of Shadows powers Shadow Casting and Cloak of Shadows. Maybe ask the MC if you can take the later as a _Mutation_.

### A Cat Person

This can go more than one way. Scary killer cat people go Bagheera. You can also just be any kind of Witch and pick up Beast Form from Call of the Wild as a starting power.

### The Mummy

There's no one official way to be a mummy. Khaibit can pull it off very easily; just grab Conspicuous Consumption as a Disadvantage and dip into Fortitude for Patience of the Mountains and Restoration - you're officially immortal now. Authority powers like Mesmerism and Cloud Memory play into the shtick as well.

Alternatively, you can go with a Revenant and add any magic you find appropriate.

### A Golem

Robots make great Golems out of the box, just choose the artificial body variant and specify that your Grotesque Aegis means you're made of clay. Spark of Knowledge works well as a Discipline for Golems to represent a relationship with the written word. If you like you can work with your MC to specify that your character's power ritual involves repeating the words that power them instead of the more usual electrical power.

### Nancy from The Craft

Nancy could easily be in either the Baali or Mekhashfim traditions, but the later probably works a little better. Call of the Wild, Veil of Morpheus, Guise, and Clout (for Telekinesis) are great choices.
