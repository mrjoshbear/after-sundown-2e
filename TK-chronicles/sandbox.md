## Sandboxes: The Setting and Background of the Chronicle

### Cast of Characters

 * PC Associates: every NPC the players just made for you: their creators, mentors, friends, family, Backup, Contacts, servants, etc.
 * Oligarchs: the rulers of the local Domain. Work out about 3 major figures in local politics, including the nominal head and powers behind the throne. These characters should define (if only by contrast) the major political factions in the locality.
 * Rivals: another Band or two that the players can compete with and define themselves against.
 * Mortal Threats: Any other hunters or stalkers likely to hassle the player characters. Including at least one luminary journalist, police detective, or private investigator is practically de rigueur. 

### Things Players Often Want to Know

 * Where can we get weapons against the supernatural? There are probably some veteran hunters (think of Bobby in Supernatural) whose primary role is to supply other hunters, in addition to armorers in the local Syndicates and/or Cults.
 * Who is the biggest badass on our side?
 * Who is the richest person we could possible reach out to?
 * Who has the sorcerous knowledge to help us out with things like having our friends Enslaved or Resurrecting a Revenant?
 * Are there any parts of town that are no-go to us?
 * Are there any local problems that will get me serious status for solving?
 * Where do other hunters or monsters hang out (so I can meet/spy on/kill/eat them)?
 * Are there any known portals to the Otherworlds we could negotiate access to?

### Places

While you can always improvise or prepare settings for characters, events, or locations, one way to provide the players a degree of agency is to create locations that that the players can choose to visit for open-ended reasons of their own. Making locations repeatedly useful to the players makes it more economical for the MC to give them life and detail, since players can visit them more than once.

 * Where do the player's' Contacts and Backup hang out?
 * Where does the local Syndicate leadership meet?
 * Where do members of the local Syndicate(s) gather to socialize?
 * Do any Cults have local headquarters?
 * Where do Vampires look for victims to drink from? 
 * Where do Troglodytes, Khaibit, and Revenants get bodies?
 * Where could we trade/fence Treasures and Secrets?

### Prompting Action: The News

Starting each Chapter or even game session with a sort of collected news bulletin is a great tool for the MC because it simultaneously gives the impression of a living and changing world beyond the player characters and presents them with a gradual drip of new information about the world that they can act on. The later is extremely valuable as a way towards having a player-driven Chronicle. It can also contextualize their own past actions by letting them find out about eventual developments that occurred after they stopped giving things their full attention.

While players should be able to take some kind of action based on every news item, it isn't actually necessary that every one of them be a mission in the supernatural world ready to play; sometimes it's okay for there to just be an animal attack that isn't a Behemoth or Lycanthrope. While this may initially seem to just be a red herring dangled to distract the players, and would be if the Chronicle was entirely driven by the MC's agenda, when the players have a degree of control over the broad arc of the narrative it could also mean that a normal animal attack could be an opportunity for them to do their own scheming. Instead of being called to cover up a supernatural event they could take advantage of the situation to frame a rival or create cover for their own violent agendas. Just try to balance the degree to which the news is doing this kind of thing based on your own Chronicle and players and try not to overdo it.
