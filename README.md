# After Sundown
_"I hope you like nightmare worlds!"_

After Sundown is a cooperative roleplaying game that explores the realm of horror. Players take on the roles of monsters out of horror movies or the humans who oppose them, while one of the players takes on the role of the MC - a combination referee, narrator, and roleplayer of last resort for antagonists and minor characters in the story.

Cooperative storytelling can be done without any products at all, as with collaborative writing or "Cops and Robbers". After Sundown provides an established world and story background along with conflict resolution in a set of mechanics to determine the results of actions with the help of six-sided dice. In this way, players of After Sundown can bypass many of the hangups of both collaborative fiction and Cops and Robbers: most notably the "I shot you/ No you did not" problem. It is hoped that the backstory and established characters of After Sundown will be sufficiently evocative as to give players of protagonists and MCs ample launching points for stories of their own.
